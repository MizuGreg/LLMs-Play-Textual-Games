I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, try to venture east. Then, venture south. After that, try to go to the south. Once you succeed at that, try to go west. If you can finish that, try to move north. That done, make an effort to take a trip east. After that, try to take a trip south. Okay, and then, try to travel south. Then, travel south. And then, venture south. After that, attempt to go east. Then, recover the coin from the floor of the bedchamber. That's it!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld. They've been moving between the Spare Room and the Attic, going back and forth between east and west. The initial instructions mentioned trying different directions and eventually recovering a coin from the bedchamber.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Spare Room again, with an exit to the east. The previous moves have been going east and west repeatedly between the two rooms. The user is asking if they're making the right actions and if they're close to the goal.

First, I need to determine if the current actions are effective. The user has been moving between the rooms without finding any objects or progressing further. The goal is to recover the coin from the bedchamber, which suggests that the coin is in a specific room that hasn't been explored yet. 

The current path seems to be stuck in a loop between the Spare Room and the Attic. The user might need to explore other directions or look for objects in the current room. Since the Spare Room has an exit to the east, maybe that leads to another room with the coin. Alternatively, the Attic might have items or a path to the bedchamber.

The user's next action should be to check the east exit again, as that's the only unblocked exit in the Spare Room. If going east leads to another room, they might find the coin or a new path. Alternatively, if the Attic has items, maybe they need to look around there. But based on the previous interactions, the user hasn't found any objects yet, so exploring the east exit again makes sense. 

The user might be overcomplicating by going back and forth. The correct approach is to systematically explore each direction and check for objects. Since the Spare Room's east exit is unblocked, going east is the logical next step. The answer should be "go east" again.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Spare Room and the Attic, moving back and forth between east and west. The goal is to recover the coin from the bedchamber. So far, the user hasn't found any objects or progressed beyond the initial rooms. The key here is to realize that repeatedly moving between the same rooms isn't effective. The next step should be to explore other directions or look for items in the current room. Since the Spare Room has an exit to the east, maybe that leads to a room with the coin. Alternatively, the Attic might have items or a path to the bedchamber. The user needs to check the east exit again to proceed further.

Okay, the user is stuck in the Attic, trying to find the coin but can't see anything. They've been moving between rooms without success. The original goal was to recover the coin from the bedchamber, but so far, no progress. The next step should be to check other directions or look for objects again. Since the user tried looking around but didn't find anything, maybe they need to try a different approach. Perhaps there's an item in the Attic that's not visible at first, or maybe they need to find a different exit. The command "look around" isn't working, so maybe "examine" or "check" could help. But according to the game's commands, "look around" is the correct verb. Since it's not working, maybe the user needs to try a different direction or check the south exit again. The south exit was mentioned as unblocked earlier, so maybe going south from the Attic is the way to go. The user might have been focused on west instead of south. So the next action should be to go south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Closet and Basement, moving back and forth. The original goal was to recover the coin from the bedchamber. So far, the user hasn't found any objects or progressed towards the bedchamber. The next step should be to check the west exit in the Basement, as mentioned in the prompt. The user has been going north and south between the Closet and Basement, but maybe the west exit leads to a different room with the coin. The command "go west" is the next logical step.

Ah, the closet. This is some kind of closet, really great typical vibes in this place, a wonderful typical atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Closet and Basement, moving back and forth. The original goal was to recover the coin from the bedchamber. So far, the user hasn't found any objects or progressed towards the bedchamber. The next step should be to check the west exit in the Basement, as mentioned in the prompt. The user has been going north and south between the Closet and Basement, but maybe the west exit leads to a different room with the coin. The command "go west" is the next logical step.

Okay, the user is in the Bedroom now. The original goal was to recover the coin from the bedchamber. The Bedroom is a standard room, and there's an exit to the north and south. The user needs to find the coin, which is likely in the bedchamber. The next step should be to check the south exit since the north exit is unguarded. Maybe the bedchamber is south of the Bedroom.
