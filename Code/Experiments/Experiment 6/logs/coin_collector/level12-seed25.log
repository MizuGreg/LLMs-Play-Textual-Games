Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be good if you could make an attempt to go west. If you can succeed at that, take a trip north. And then, travel east. Then, venture east. Okay, and then, attempt to travel east. Following that, make an attempt to venture north. And then, go west. That done, venture south. Next, try to head east. With that accomplished, travel east. Then, move south. And then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the laundry place. And if you do that, you're the winner!
