Welcome to another exciting game of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be a great idea if you could make an attempt to venture south. If you can manage that, take a trip east. Then, make an effort to go east. With that done, pick up the coin from the floor of the pantry. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Studio =-
You've entered a studio. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an unguarded exit to the south.

>                                                                                                                                -= Studio =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go south
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Sauna =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a sauna.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

You arrive in a pantry. An usual kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

There is a coin on the floor.
