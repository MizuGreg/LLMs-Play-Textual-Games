Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an attempt to travel north. If you can get through with that, pick-up the coin from the floor of the workshop. Alright, thanks!

-= Study =-
You are in a study. A normal one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

-= Workshop =-
You've entered a workshop. You begin to take stock of what's here.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a coin on the floor.
