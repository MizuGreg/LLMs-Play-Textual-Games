You are now playing a life changing episode of TextWorld! First of all, attempt to move south. With that done, attempt to go east. And then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the sauna. Alright, thanks!

-= Studio =-
You are in a studio. An usual kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

>                                                                                                                                -= Studio =-0/1

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the north.

-= Sauna =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so standard all of a sudden, it's because you've just shown up in the sauna.



There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Sauna =-0/3
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in the sauna, and there's a coin on the floor. The original goal was to retrieve the coin from the floor of the sauna. So the next step should be to pick up the coin. The user has already moved south and east to get here. Now, in the sauna, they need to pick up the coin. The command should be "take coin" or "get coin". But the game might expect a specific term. Let me check the previous commands. The user was told to "retrieve the coin from the floor of the sauna." So the correct action is to take the coin. The response should be "take coin".
</think>take coin
