Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to venture north. And then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the basement. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. An ordinary kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Basement =-
You find yourself in a basement. A typical kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an unguarded exit to the south.

There is a coin on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the basement, and they found a coin on the floor. The goal was to retrieve the coin from the basement's floor. Since the coin is already there, the next step is to pick it up. But the game's command structure might require a specific action. The user is in the basement, and the previous action was going north. Now, they need to pick up the coin. The correct command would be "take coin" or "get coin". But I need to check if the game expects "take" or "pick up". In many text adventures, "take" is the standard command. So the next action should be "take coin".
