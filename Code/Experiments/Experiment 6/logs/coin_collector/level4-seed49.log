Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be good if you could try to take a trip east. If you can get around to doing that, try to move east. And then, make an effort to take a trip north. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the workshop. And if you do that, you're the winner!
