I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, try to move north. Once you finish that, make an effort to venture east. And then, make an effort to head east. And then, try to head north. Okay, and then, attempt to go west. Once you finish that, make an effort to move west. And then, go to the south. And then, make an attempt to move west. Then, take a trip south. And then, make an attempt to go south. And then, go east. That done, travel south. And then, make an effort to go east. Next, pick up the coin from the floor of the salon. That's it!
