Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be a great idea if you could make an effort to head west. With that done, move south. And then, head east. And then, move east. Next, make an attempt to venture east. Then, make an attempt to go to the east. Next, make an attempt to go north. And then, attempt to venture west. And then, make an attempt to move south. With that done, try to travel west. Next, try to head south. If you can get around to doing that, move south. Okay, and then, take a trip east. If you can finish that, pick-up the coin from the floor of the canteen. And once you've done that, you win!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a TextWorld game set in a laundromat. The goal is to navigate through the rooms, move in specific directions, and pick up a coin in the canteen. The user has been repeatedly moving west and east, alternating between the Laundromat and Chamber rooms. The instruction mentions moving west, then south, east, east, north, west, south, and finally east to pick up the coin.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Laundromat again, and the available directions are west (unguarded) and east (unblocked). The previous moves have been going back and forth between the two rooms. The user might be stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and Chamber. The original plan was to go west, then south, but the current position might not allow that. Maybe the south direction is blocked or requires a different path. Alternatively, the coin might be in the canteen, which is part of the Laundromat. The user needs to find the canteen and pick up the coin.

Since the user is in the Laundromat, perhaps the next step is to check if moving south is possible. But in the previous steps, when in the Laundromat, the south direction wasn't mentioned as unguarded. Wait, the user's last action was going west, which brought them back to the Laundromat. The prompt says "You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded." So maybe the user needs to go south from the Laundromat. But in the current state, the available directions are west and east. Wait, maybe the user needs to go south from the Chamber. But the user is in the Laundromat now. Hmm.

Wait, the initial instructions said to go west, then south, then east, east, north, west, south, west, south, and then east to pick up the coin. But the user's movement has been oscillating between west and east, which might not be the correct path. Maybe the user needs to find a way to get to the canteen. The coin is in the canteen, so the user needs to reach there. But the current position is the Laundromat. Maybe the canteen is part of the Laundromat, and the user needs to move south from the Laundromat to get there. However, in the current prompt, when in the Laundromat, the available directions are west (unguarded) and east (unblocked). The user might need to go south, but that's not listed as an option. Wait, the user is in the Laundromat, and the prompt says "You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded." So maybe the user can't go south from here. Alternatively, maybe the user is in the Chamber, and the available directions are east and south. But the user is in the Laundromat now. This is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to move east from the Laundromat to reach the canteen. But the user has been moving west and east repeatedly. The original instruction says after moving west, then south, then east, east, north, west, south, west, south, and then east. But the user is stuck in a loop. Maybe the correct path is to go west, then south, but the user needs to check if south is possible. However, in the current state, when in the Laundromat, the user can only go west or east. So maybe the user needs to go east to the Chamber, then south from there. But the user is in the Laundromat. Wait, the user's last action was going west, which brought them back to the Laundromat. The next step is to go east again, which would take them back to the Chamber. Then, from the Chamber, they can go south. So the next action should be go east to get to the Chamber, then go south. But the user is in the Laundromat, so the next move is east. But the user has been moving east repeatedly. Maybe the user needs to go south from the Chamber. So the next action is go east to the Chamber, then go south. But the user is in the Laundromat, so the next command is go east. The user's last input was go west, so the next step is go east. Then, from the Chamber, go south. That would be the correct path. So the next action is go east.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out the right path here. The user is in a loop between the Laundromat and Chamber, moving west and east repeatedly. The original goal was to navigate through specific directions: west, south, east, east, north, west, south, west, south, then east to pick up the coin in the canteen.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Chamber again. The available directions are east and south. The Studio was visited earlier, but the user hasn't explored it further. Maybe the canteen is in the Studio or connected to it. The user needs to go south from the Chamber to reach the Studio, then perhaps find the canteen there. But the user was previously stuck in the Laundromat, so maybe the correct path is to go south from the Chamber to the Studio, then check for the coin. However, the user's last action was going west, which brought them back to the Chamber. The next step should be to go south from the Chamber to the Studio. But the user might not have explored the Studio yet. Let me check the previous steps.

In the Studio, there's an exit to the east and a suggestion to go north. The user was in the Studio, then went north back to the Chamber. Now, in the Chamber, the user needs to go south again to return to the Studio. From the Studio, maybe the canteen is located, and the coin is there. So the next action should be to go south from the Chamber to the Studio, then check if the coin is available. But the user hasn't picked it up yet. Alternatively, maybe the canteen is in the Laundromat, and the user needs to find it by moving south from the Laundromat. However, in the Laundromat, the user can't go south. The user is in the Chamber now, so going south would take them to the Studio. From the Studio, perhaps the canteen is accessible. The user needs to go east from the Studio to exit, but the original goal mentions moving east to pick up the coin. Maybe the coin is in the Studio, and the user needs to check there. So the next action is to go south from the Chamber to the Studio, then look for the coin. But the user hasn't done that yet. The correct next step is to go south from the Chamber.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and Chamber, moving west and east repeatedly. The original goal was to navigate through specific directions to reach the canteen and pick up the coin. The user has been going back and forth between the Laundromat and Chamber, but hasn't found the canteen yet.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Laundromat again. The available direction is west, which is unguarded. But the user needs to get to the canteen. Earlier, the user was in the Studio, which might be connected to the canteen. The Studio has an exit to the east and a suggestion to go north. Maybe the canteen is in the Studio, and the user needs to check there.

But the user hasn't explored the Studio beyond the initial entry. The previous steps showed that going south from the Chamber leads to the Studio. From the Studio, the user could go north back to the Chamber or east to exit. However, the original goal mentioned moving east to pick up the coin, which might be in the canteen. The user needs to find the canteen, which is probably in the Studio or connected to it.

Since the user is in the Laundromat again, the next step should be to go west again, but that just brings them back to the Chamber. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the Laundromat to the Chamber, then south to the Studio, and then look for the canteen. But the user has been doing that repeatedly without success.

Wait, the user's last action was going west, which brought them to the Chamber. The next step should be to go south from the Chamber to the Studio. From the Studio, they can check if the canteen is there. The user might need to explore the Studio more thoroughly. However, the game's prompt in the Studio says to go north, but the user has been going back and forth.

Perhaps the canteen is in the Studio, and the user needs to look for it there. The user hasn't picked up the coin yet, so maybe the coin is in the Studio. The next action should be to go south from the Chamber to the Studio, then check the area. But the user is in the Laundromat, so the correct next step is to go west to the Chamber, then south to the Studio. However, the user is already in the Laundromat, so the next command is go west again. But that's what they've been doing. Maybe the user needs to go east from the Laundromat to the Chamber, then south to the Studio, and then look for the canteen. But the user is in the Laundromat, so the next step is go west to the Chamber. Then go south to the Studio. From there, maybe the canteen is accessible. The user needs to find the canteen and pick up the coin. So the next action is go west to the Chamber, then south to the Studio. But the user is in the Laundromat, so the next command is go west.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and Chamber, moving west and east repeatedly. The original goal was to navigate through specific directions to reach the canteen and pick up the coin. The user has been going back and forth between the Laundromat and Chamber, but hasn't found the canteen yet.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Studio again. The available directions are east and north. The Studio has an exit to the east, which might be the way to the canteen. The user needs to move east from the Studio to exit and possibly find the canteen. The original goal mentioned moving east to pick up the coin, so maybe the canteen is exit to the east. The user should go east from the Studio to reach the canteen and pick up the coin. Therefore, the next action is to go east.
