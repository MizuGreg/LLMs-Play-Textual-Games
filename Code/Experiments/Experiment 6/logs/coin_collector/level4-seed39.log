Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, head north. And then, make an attempt to go east. With that done, go east. Next, lift the coin from the floor of the bedchamber. Got that? Good!

-= Restroom =-
Okay, so you're in a restroom, cool, but is it usual? You better believe it is.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.
