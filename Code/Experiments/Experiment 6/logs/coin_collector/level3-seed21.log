Welcome to another fast paced session of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, travel east. Okay, and then, travel north. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the closet. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Canteen =-
You find yourself in a canteen. An ordinary kind of place.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east.
