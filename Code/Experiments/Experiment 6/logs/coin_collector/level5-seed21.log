Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, travel east. Okay, and then, travel north. And then, go north. Once you accomplish that, make an effort to go west. And then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the sauna. Alright, thanks!

-= Canteen =-
You arrive in a canteen. An ordinary one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east.
