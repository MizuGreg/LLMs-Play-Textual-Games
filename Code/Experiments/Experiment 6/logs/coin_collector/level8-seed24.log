I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to head west. And then, attempt to travel north. Once you manage that, go north. And then, make an attempt to venture east. After that, take a trip north. Following that, take a trip west. After that, go to the west. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the bar. And once you've done that, you win!
