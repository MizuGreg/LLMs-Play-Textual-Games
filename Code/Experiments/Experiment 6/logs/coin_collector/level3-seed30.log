It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to go west. After that, try to head north. And then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the canteen. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedchamber =-
Well I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a bedchamber. You can barely contain your excitement.



There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Kitchen =-
Ah, the kitchen. This is some kind of kitchen, really great typical vibes in this place, a wonderful typical atmosphere.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.
