Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, go to the east. Following that, attempt to go south. After that, take a trip east. Then, attempt to move east. Okay, and then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the recreation zone. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Study =-
Look at you, bigshot, walking into a study like it isn't some huge deal. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an unblocked exit to the east.

-= Cubicle =-
You are in a cubicle. An ordinary one.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Well, here we are in the office.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld. The goal seems to be to pick up a coin in the recreation zone and then reach the original goal. So far, the user has moved east from the study, then south to the cubicle, and then east to the office. Now, they're in the office, and the prompt says there's an exit to the east and suggests going north instead.

The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. Let me recall the initial instructions: the user was told to go east, then south, then east again, then attempt to move east again, and then pick up the coin in the recreation zone. So far, they've done the first three steps: east (study to cubicle?), south (cubicle to office?), and then east again (office to where? Maybe the recreation zone?).

Wait, the initial directions were: go east, then south, then east, then east again. But in the current state, they're in the office. The office has an exit to the east and suggests going north. The user needs to pick up the coin in the recreation zone. So maybe the recreation zone is north of the office? Or maybe the next step is to go east from the office to reach the recreation zone. But the prompt says that in the office, the exit to the east is unblocked, but the suggestion is to go north. Hmm.

Wait, the user's current location is the office. The office has an exit to the east. The initial instructions said to "attempt to move east" after going east, south, east. So maybe the next step is to go east from the office. But the prompt says "You should try going north" instead. Maybe the user is supposed to go north from the office to reach the recreation zone? Or maybe the recreation zone is east of the office. The user needs to pick up the coin in the recreation zone, so they need to get there.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the office to reach the recreation zone. But the prompt says that in the office, the exit to the east is unblocked, so perhaps that's the correct direction. However, the suggestion is to go north. Maybe the user is confused. Let me check the initial instructions again.

The original instructions were: go east, then south, then east, then east again, then pick up the coin. So after the first three moves (east, south, east), the next step is to go east again. But in the current state, the user is in the office, which is after going east from the cubicle (which was south of the study). Wait, maybe the path is study -> cubicle (south) -> office (east?) -> then maybe the next step is to go east again from the office to reach the recreation zone. But the prompt says that in the office, the exit to the east is unblocked, so perhaps that's the correct direction. However, the suggestion is to go north. Maybe the user is supposed to go north from the office to reach the recreation zone. But that's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the office to reach the recreation zone. The initial instructions said to go east again after the first three steps. So the next step is to go east from the office. But the prompt says that in the office, the exit to the east is unblocked, so that's the correct move. However, the suggestion is to go north. Maybe the user is supposed to go north to reach the recreation zone. But I'm not sure. The user needs to pick up the coin in the recreation zone, so they need to get there. The initial instructions said to go east, then south, then east, then east again. So after the office, the next step is east again. Therefore, the correct action is to go east from the office. But the prompt says that in the office, the exit to the east is unblocked, so that's the right move. The suggestion to go north might be a red herring or a mistake. So the user should go east again from the office to reach the recreation zone and pick up the coin.

-= Attic =-
Well, here we are in an attic.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Recreation Zone =-
I just think it's awesome that you're in a recreation zone now. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a coin on the floor.
