Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Your first objective is to venture north. And then, take a trip east. Then, move east. After that, make an effort to take a trip south. Okay, and then, take a trip west. And then, make an attempt to take a trip west. And then, make an effort to head south. With that done, make an attempt to go to the south. If you can succeed at that, attempt to head south. With that done, retrieve the coin from the floor of the washroom. And if you do that, you're the winner!

You're now in a canteen. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has followed a specific sequence of directions. The initial instructions were to go north, then east, then east again, then south, west, west, south, south again, and finally retrieve a coin in the washroom.

So far, the user has gone north from the canteen to the basement. The next step in their plan was to go east. The basement's description mentions that going east is possible, and the south exit is unguarded. But the user's next move after entering the basement would be to go east as per their original plan. However, the user is now asking if they're on the right track and what their next action should be.

Wait, the user's last action was "go north" from the canteen to the basement. The current location is the basement. The next step in their plan was to take a trip east. The basement's description says "You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded." So the user's next move should be east, as per the original plan. But the user is now asking if they're close to the goal. The original goal was to retrieve the coin in the washroom. So far, they've moved north, then east, then east again, then south, west, west, south, south, and then to the washroom. But the current location is the basement, and the next step is east. So the user needs to proceed east from the basement. The answer should be "go east" as the next command.

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An ordinary kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. Their goal is to follow a series of directions: go north, then east, east, south, west, west, south, south again, then get a coin from the washroom.

So far, they've started in the canteen, went north to the basement, then east to the bedroom. Now they're in the bedroom. The next step according to the original instructions is to move east again. The bedroom has an exit to the east and west. The user's last action was "go east", which took them to the bedroom. Now, the next step in the sequence is to move east again. But wait, the current location is the bedroom. The exit to the east is unblocked. So the correct next action should be to go east again. The user needs to follow the steps in order: after the bedroom, go east. Then, according to the original plan, after that, they need to move south, west, etc. But the user's next action should be "go east" again. The assistant should just output that command.

-= Kitchenette =-
Well, here we are in a kitchenette.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually retrieve a coin in the washroom. The original goal mentioned was to go north, then east, east again, south, west, west, south, south again, and then get the coin.

So far, the user has moved from the canteen to the basement, then to the bedroom, and then to the kitchenette. The current room is the kitchenette. The directions mentioned here are east and south. The user's next action should follow the original plan. 

Looking back at the original steps: after the bedroom, the next was to go east again. But in the kitchenette, the options are to go south or west. Wait, the user's path so far is canteen (north) -> basement (east) -> bedroom (east) -> kitchenette (now). The original plan was after the bedroom, go east again. But in the kitchenette, the east direction is mentioned as an exit? Wait, no. Let me check the previous steps again.

Wait, in the bedroom, the user went east to the kitchenette. Now in the kitchenette, the directions are: east is unblocked? Wait, the description says: "You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west." So in the kitchenette, the exits are south and west. So the user can't go east from here. So the original plan was to go east again from the bedroom, but that led to the kitchenette. Now, the next step in the original plan was to move east again. But in the kitchenette, the east direction isn't an exit. So maybe the user needs to go south or west from here.

Wait, the original plan was: after the bedroom, go east (to kitchenette), then move east again? But that's not possible. So maybe the user needs to adjust. Alternatively, maybe the original plan had a different sequence. Let me recheck the original instructions.

Original goal: venture north (done), take a trip east (done), move east (done), take a trip south (next?), then west, west, south, south, then get the coin.

So after the bedroom, the next step was to move east again. But in the kitchenette, the user is here. The kitchenette's exits are south and west. So maybe the user needs to go south from the kitchenette. But according to the original plan, after the kitchenette, the next step would be to go south. Let me check the original steps again.

Original steps: after the bedroom, the user was supposed to move east (which they did to get to kitchenette), then take a trip south. So from the kitchenette, the next step is to go south. So the user should go south here. Then, after that, the plan was to go west, west, south, south, etc.

So the next action should be to go south from the kitchenette. That's the correct step here. The user is in the kitchenette, and the next step is to go south. So the answer is "go south".

-= Shower =-
Well I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a shower.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game: canteen, basement, bedroom, kitchenette, and now the shower. The original goal was to venture north, then east, east again, south, west, west, south, south again, retrieve the coin from the washroom, and win.

So far, the user has gone north from the canteen, then east to the basement, then east again to the bedroom, then east again to the kitchenette, then south to the shower. Now, in the shower, the exits are north and west. The next step according to the original plan was after going south from the kitchenette (which they did to get to the shower), then they need to go west. The user's next action should be to go west from the shower. That's the next step in the sequence. The user has to follow the directions step by step, so going west here makes sense. The goal is to reach the washroom and get the coin, so moving west from the shower is part of that path. I need to make sure the user continues following the planned steps correctly.

-= Laundromat =-
You arrive in a laundromat. A normal kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

The next steps in the original plan after the laundromat would be to go west again, but the user might need to check if that's the right direction. However, the laundromat's exits are east and west. The user's previous actions have been going east and west alternately. The next step in the original plan was to go west again. But the user is at the laundromat, and the next action should be to go west. However, the user might need to check if that's the correct path. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east first. But according to the original plan, after the laundromat, the next step was to go west again. Wait, the original plan was: after the laundromat, the next step was to go west, then south again. But the user is at the laundromat, and the exits are east and west. The user's next action should be to go west, as per the original plan. So the answer is go west.

So far, the user has moved through the canteen, basement, bedroom, kitchenette, shower, laundromat, and now the bar. The current location is the bar, and the available exits are east and south. The next steps in the original plan after the bar would be to go south, then maybe east again, but the user needs to check if they're on the right track.

The user's next action should be to go south, as per the original instructions. The bar's south exit is unguarded, so that's doable. After that, they might need to go east again. But since the user is asking if they're close to the goal, I need to make sure they're following the correct path. The coin is in the washroom, which was earlier in the path (shower). So maybe after moving south from the bar, they'll reach the shower again, then go west to the laundromat, but the original plan says after the last south, they need to get the coin. Wait, the original goal says after all those movements, retrieve the coin from the washroom. So the user needs to navigate back to the washroom, which is the shower area. 

But the current location is the bar. Going south from the bar would take them to the shower (since the shower's north exit is unblocked). Then from the shower, they can go west to the laundromat, but the coin is in the washroom, which might be the shower area. So the next step is to go south from the bar, then check the shower area for the coin. So the correct next action is to go south.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

The original goal mentioned going south after some steps, so maybe the next move should be south. However, the user needs to check if that's the correct direction towards the washroom where the coin is. The coin is in the washroom, which was part of the earlier rooms. The user might need to go back through the previous rooms. But according to the original instructions, after reaching the playroom, the next step was to go south.

Okay, let's see. The user is navigating through different rooms in a text-based game. Their goal is to follow a series of directions: go north, then east, east again, south, west, west again, south, and then finally retrieve a coin from the washroom.

So far, the user has moved from the canteen to the basement, then to the bedroom, kitchenette, shower, laundromat, bar, playroom, and sauna. Each time, they've been following the hints given in the environment descriptions, like choosing unguarded exits or unblocked paths. 

Now, in the sauna, the prompt says to either go north or south. The user's next move would be to go south, as per the previous pattern of moving south after some east or west movements. But wait, the original goal mentioned going south after certain steps. Let me check the original instructions again.

The original goal was: venture north, then east, east again, south, west, west again, south, then south again, and finally retrieve the coin in the washroom. So after the sauna, the next step would be to go south, which would take them back to the playroom or another area. But the user is currently in the sauna, and the options are north or south. Since the previous step was going south from the playroom to the sauna, going north from the sauna would take them back to the playroom. However, the user's next action should be to go south again, as per the original plan. But the sauna's description says south is unguarded. So the correct next move is south. But wait, the user is in the sauna, and the next step after sauna would be to go south, which might lead them to the playroom again or another area. However, the original goal mentions after going south from the sauna, they need to retrieve the coin in the washroom. But the washroom was part of the earlier steps. Maybe the user needs to navigate back to the washroom. But according to the current path, the user is in the sauna, and the next move is south. So the correct command here is to go south.

Okay, let me try to figure out what the next step should be here. The user's goal was to navigate through various rooms in TextWorld, moving in specific directions and eventually retrieving a coin from the washroom. So far, they've been moving north, east, south, west, and back, ending up in the washroom.

In the washroom, the description mentions a coin on the floor. The user's last action was moving south to get here. The current room is the washroom, and the coin is there. The next step should be to pick up the coin. The user's original instruction said to "retrieve the coin from the floor of the washroom. And if you do that, you're the winner!" So the final action is to take the coin.

The command should be "take coin" or something similar. But in TextWorld, the correct command might be "take coin" or "get coin". Since the user has been using "go direction" commands, maybe "take coin" is the right action here. The user needs to pick up the coin to win. So the next action is to take the coin from the floor.
