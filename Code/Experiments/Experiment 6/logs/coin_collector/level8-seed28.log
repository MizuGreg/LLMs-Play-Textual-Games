Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, travel east. With that over with, head north. Then, make an effort to travel west. Then, venture south. And then, make an effort to move east. Then, move north. That done, make an attempt to go west. With that done, pick-up the coin from the floor of the basement. Got that? Good!
