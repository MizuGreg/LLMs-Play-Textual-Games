Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be a great idea if you could go west. And then, move west. That done, go west. Then, try to go to the south. With that over with, attempt to go to the east. With that accomplished, venture north. And then, make an attempt to travel west. Okay, and then, take a trip west. Then, recover the coin from the floor of the garage. Got that? Good!
