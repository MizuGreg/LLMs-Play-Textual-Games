Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, attempt to move east. That done, head south. Once you manage that, recover the coin from the floor of the workshop. Got that? Good!

-= Sauna =-
Well how about that, you are in the place we're calling the sauna. The room is well lit.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Kitchen =-
Well, here we are in a kitchen.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.
