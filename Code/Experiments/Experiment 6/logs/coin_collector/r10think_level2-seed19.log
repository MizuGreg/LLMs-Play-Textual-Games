Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First of all, make an attempt to venture west. Then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the cubicle. Got that? Good!

-= Laundry Place =-
You find yourself in a normal kind of place. That is to say, you're in a laundry place. You start to take note of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Cubicle =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the cubicle. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east.

There is a coin on the floor.
