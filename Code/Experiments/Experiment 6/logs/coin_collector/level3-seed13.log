It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, make an effort to head west. With that done, move south. And then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the canteen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Laundromat =-
You find yourself in a laundromat. A standard one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

>                                                                                                                                -= Laundromat =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Chamber =-
You've just walked into a chamber. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

go south
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Canteen =-
You are in a canteen. A standard kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Canteen =-0/3
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
