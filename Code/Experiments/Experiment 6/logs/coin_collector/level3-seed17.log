You are now playing a profound episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, make an attempt to head east. Following that, make an attempt to venture south. Then, pick up the coin from the floor of the salon. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Pantry =-
You find yourself in a pantry. A standard one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.
