I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, make an attempt to head east. Following that, make an attempt to venture south. Then, make an effort to take a trip south. And then, make an effort to travel south. If you can manage that, pick-up the coin from the floor of the office. That's it!

-= Pantry =-
You are in a pantry. A standard kind of place.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Bar =-
You are in a bar. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

You arrive in a kitchen. A typical one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text adventure game, moving through different rooms. The goal is to pick up a coin from the office. So far, they've gone east from the pantry, then south into the bar, then south again into the salon, and now they're in the kitchen. The kitchen has exits to the north and south.

The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. Let me recap the path:

Pantry (east) → Bar (south) → Salon (south) → Kitchen (north/south). The original instructions said to go east, then south three times. Wait, the first instruction was to go east, then south three times. But in the current setup, the user is in the kitchen. Let me check the rooms again.

The pantry's east exit leads to the bar. Then from the bar, south to the salon. Then from the salon, south again to the kitchen. So that's three south moves. But the original instruction was to go east, then south three times. Wait, maybe the user is supposed to go east once, then south three times. But the user has already done east once (to bar), then south twice (to salon, then to kitchen). So they need one more south to reach the office?

Wait, the original instruction said: "make an attempt to head east. Following that, make an attempt to venture south. Then, make an effort to take a trip south. And then, make an effort to travel south." So that's east once, then south three times. So after the kitchen, the next step would be south again. But the kitchen's south exit is unguarded. So the user should go south from the kitchen to reach the office. Then pick up the coin.

So the next action should be go south from the kitchen. Then they would be in the office, where the coin is on the floor. So the correct next step is to go south again.

-= Office =-
You're now in an office.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

There is a coin on the floor.
