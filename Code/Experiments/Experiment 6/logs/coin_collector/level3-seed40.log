Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First stop, attempt to go to the south. And then, make an attempt to travel west. That done, retrieve the coin from the floor of the workshop. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Basement =-
You've just shown up in a basement.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Spare Room =-
You arrive in a spare room. An usual one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.
