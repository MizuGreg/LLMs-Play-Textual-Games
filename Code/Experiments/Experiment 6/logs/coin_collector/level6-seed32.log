Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an attempt to take a trip south. With that accomplished, venture west. Next, make an attempt to venture west. Following that, venture south. Then, move west. Next, pick-up the coin from the floor of the vault. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bathroom =-
Well how about that, you are in the place we're calling the bathroom.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.
