Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First stop, head west. Then, make an attempt to take a trip north. And then, make an attempt to head east. Then, make an effort to travel north. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the bedchamber. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Shower =-
You have fallen into a shower. Not the shower you'd expect. No, this is a shower.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Workshop =-
Ah, the workshop. This is some kind of workshop, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchenette =-
You find yourself in a kitchenette. A normal kind of place.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Canteen =-
You arrive in a canteen. An usual kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Canteen =-0/4
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has been moving through different rooms: shower, workshop, kitchenette, canteen. The goal is to recover a coin from the bedchamber.

So far, they've gone west, north, east, and now they're in the canteen. The canteen has an unblocked exit to the north and an unguarded exit to the west. The next step would be to check if moving north from the canteen leads them closer to the bedchamber. Since the previous steps involved moving in different directions, maybe the next logical step is to go north again. But wait, the user's last action was going east to the canteen. The prompt says to make an attempt to head east again, but that's already done. Wait, the original task was: first stop, head west. Then attempt to take a trip north. Then attempt to head east. Then travel north again. Then recover the coin.

So after the canteen, the next step in the original plan is to travel north again. The canteen's north exit is unblocked, so that's probably the way to go. The user is in the canteen now, so going north from there would be the next step. Then, after reaching the next room, they might find the bedchamber or the coin. So the next action should be 'go north' again.

-= Bedchamber =-
Fancy seeing you here. Here, by the way, being the bedchamber.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a coin on the floor.
