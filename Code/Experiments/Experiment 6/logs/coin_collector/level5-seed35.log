Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be good if you could make an effort to venture south. With that done, go to the south. Once you do that, make an attempt to move west. And then, travel south. And then, lift the coin from the floor of the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Cookery =-
You arrive in a cookery. An usual kind of place.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
