Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, make an attempt to travel north. If you can get through with that, go to the east. Then, go north. Following that, take a trip north. With that done, head north. With that accomplished, make an attempt to head west. With that over with, try to venture north. And then, make an effort to travel north. That done, go west. Okay, and then, venture south. And then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the restroom. Once that's all handled, you can stop!
