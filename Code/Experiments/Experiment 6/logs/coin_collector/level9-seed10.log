Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, try to venture east. Then, venture south. After that, try to go to the south. Once you succeed at that, try to go west. If you can finish that, try to move north. That done, make an effort to take a trip east. After that, try to take a trip south. Okay, and then, try to travel south. Then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the closet. Got that? Good!

You've just sauntered into a spare room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up a coin from a closet. The current room is the Attic, and they've been told to go east, then south, west, north, and so on. The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal.

First, I need to recall the previous steps. The user started in the Spare Room, went east to the Attic. Now, in the Attic, the directions available are south and west. The original instructions said to go east, then south, then west, then north, etc. But the user is now in the Attic, and the next steps according to the initial instructions would be to go south again. However, the user is asking if they're close to the goal. 

The goal is to pick up the coin from the closet. So, the user needs to find the closet and get the coin. The current room is the Attic. Maybe the closet is in a different room. Let me think about the possible paths. From the Attic, going south or west. Let's say they go south first. But the user's previous action was going east from the Spare Room to the Attic. Now, in the Attic, the next step according to the initial instructions was to go south. But the user is asking if they're close. 

Wait, the original instructions were a bit confusing. The user was told to go east, then south, then west, then north, then east again, then south, then south again, and finally pick up the coin from the closet. So maybe after moving around, they need to find the closet. 

But in the current state, the user is in the Attic. The next step would be to go south, as per the initial instructions. However, the user is asking if they're close. Since the coin is in the closet, maybe the closet is in a room that's reachable from the Attic. Let's assume that going south from the Attic leads to a room that has the closet. Alternatively, maybe the closet is in the Spare Room or another room. 

But based on the current information, the user is in the Attic. The next action should be to go south as per the initial instructions. However, the user is asking if they're close. Since the instructions mention going south multiple times, perhaps the user is on the right path. But without knowing the exact layout, it's hard to say. However, the user is following the steps given, so the next action should be to go south. 

Wait, the user's last action was going east to the Attic. Now, in the Attic, the directions are south and west. The initial instructions said after going east, go south. So the next step is to go south. Then, after that, go west, then north, etc. So the user is following the steps correctly. Therefore, the next action should be to go south. But the user is asking if they're close. Since the coin is in the closet, maybe after moving around, they'll reach the closet. So the answer is to go south.

-= Steam Room =-
You've just shown up in a steam room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been moving through different rooms. The original goal was to venture east, then south, then west, north, east again, south, and finally pick up the coin from the closet. So far, they've gone from the Spare Room to the Attic, then to the Steam Room.

In the Steam Room, the available directions are north and south. The user's next action would be to choose between those. The original plan was to go south after moving east, then west, etc. But in the Steam Room, the user is already in a new room. Let me check the path again.

Original steps: East, South, South, West, North, East, South, then pick up the coin. So after the Steam Room, maybe the next step is to go south again? But the user is in the Steam Room now. The directions here are north and south. The user has to follow the sequence. Let me think: after the Steam Room, going south would take them to the next room. But the original plan was to go south after moving east, then south again. Wait, maybe the user is on the right track. The next step after the Steam Room would be to go south again, as per the original instructions. But the user's current position is the Steam Room. So the next command should be to go south. But the user is in the Steam Room, and the directions are north and south. The user needs to go south to continue the path. So the next action is go south.

-= Bedchamber =-
You arrive in a bedchamber. An ordinary one.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

Okay, let's see. The user is navigating through different rooms in a text-based game. Their goal is to follow a series of directions: first, go east, then south, then west, north, east again, south again, and finally pick up a coin from the closet.

So far, the user has moved from the Spare Room to the Attic, then to the Steam Room, and now to the Bedchamber. The current room is the Bedchamber, which has exits to the north and west. The next steps in the original instruction are to go west after moving north. Wait, the user's previous action was going south from the Steam Room to the Bedchamber. Now, in the Bedchamber, the exits are north and west. 

The original instructions said after moving north, try to go east, then south, etc. But the user's path so far has been east, south, south, and now they're in the Bedchamber. The next step according to the original plan was to go west after moving north. Wait, maybe I need to check the sequence again.

Original instructions: First, go east. Then south. Then south again. Then west. Then north. Then east, then south, then pick up the coin. So after the initial east, south, south, the next was west. But in the current room (Bedchamber), the user can go north or west. The original plan after moving south twice would be to go west. So maybe the next step is to go west from the Bedchamber. But the user is in the Bedchamber, which has a north and west exit. So going west would be the next step as per the original plan. Then after that, the next step was to go north. So the user should go west now.

-= Chamber =-
Okay, so you're in a chamber, cool, but is it usual? You better believe it is. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

So far, the user has moved from the Spare Room to the Attic, then to the Steam Room, Bedchamber, and now the Chamber. The current room is the Chamber, and the possible exits are east and north. The user's next action should be to go north, as per the original instructions. The user is supposed to move north after going west. The next step in the sequence is to go north. The user needs to continue following the path as instructed. The coin is in the closet, so after navigating through the rooms, they need to find the closet and pick up the coin. But the current step is to go north from the Chamber. So the correct command is "go north".

So far, the user has moved through the Spare Room, Attic, Steam Room, Bedchamber, Chamber, and now the Kitchenette. The current room is the Kitchenette, which has exits to the east and south. The user's next steps should be to go east again as per the original instructions. But wait, the original instructions mention after moving north, they need to take an east trip again, then south, then south again, and then pick up the coin.

But in the current room (Kitchenette), the user can go east or south. The next action in the sequence is to go east again. However, the user might need to check if the coin is in the closet. But the closet hasn't been mentioned yet. Maybe after moving through these rooms, the user will reach a closet where the coin is. But according to the original instructions, after moving south twice, they need to pick up the coin from the closet.

But the user hasn't encountered a closet yet. So perhaps the next steps are to continue moving as per the original plan. The original plan after moving north (which was done in the Chamber) was to take an east trip, then south, then south again. So in the Kitchenette, going east would be the next step. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go south from here. But according to the original instructions, after moving north, the next steps are east, then south, then south again. So in the Kitchenette, the user should go east first. However, the user's previous action was going north to reach the Kitchenette. The next step in the original plan is to go east again. So the correct next action is to go east. But the user might be confused because the current room has an exit to the east and south. The original instructions say after moving north, take an east trip, so the user should go east here. Then, after that, go south twice. So the next action is east.

So far, the user has followed the path: east, south, south, west, north, east, south. Now in the Basement, the next step according to the previous pattern might be to go west, as the last direction was south. But the Basement's description says there's an exit to the west and south. The user needs to pick up the coin from the closet, which might be in a different area. However, the current room is the Basement. Maybe the coin is in the closet here? Or perhaps the user needs to go back to previous rooms. But the user's last action was going south from the Kitchenette to the Basement. The next step might be to check the west direction, as the Basement has an exit to the west. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back north to the Kitchenette again. But the original goal mentions going south again after the last steps. Wait, the original instructions said after moving north, take an east trip, then south, then south again, then pick up the coin. So maybe the user is close to the closet where the coin is. But the current room is the Basement. Maybe the closet is in the Basement, and the user needs to go west to reach it. The Basement's description says there's an exit to the west, so going west from the Basement might lead to the closet. So the next action should be go west.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and eventually pick up a coin from the closet. The original instructions mentioned a specific sequence of directions: east, south, south, west, north, east, south, south, and then pick up the coin.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Kitchenette again (room 8). The previous moves have been going back and forth between the Kitchenette, Basement, and other rooms. The goal is to reach the closet and pick up the coin. 

The user's current position is the Kitchenette, which has an exit to the east and south. The original plan was to go east, south, south, west, north, etc. But since they've looped back to the Kitchenette, maybe they need to find a different path. 

Wait, the original instruction said after moving north, take an east, then south, then south. But in the current state, the user is in the Kitchenette again. Maybe they need to go east from here to reach the basement again, then find the closet. Alternatively, maybe the closet is in a different room. 

Looking at the previous rooms: the Chamber, Steam Room, Bedchamber, Attic, Spare Room. The basement is room 7, and the Kitchenette is room 8. The user might need to go from the Kitchenette (room 8) east to the basement (room 7), then check if the closet is there. But in the basement description, there's an exit to the west (back to Kitchenette) and south. Wait, the basement is room 7, and the user is now in room 8 (Kitchenette). So maybe the closet is in the basement or another room. 

Alternatively, maybe the closet is in the Chamber or another room. The user needs to find the closet and pick up the coin. Since the original goal was to pick up the coin from the closet, the user needs to locate the closet. 

In the current state, the user is in the Kitchenette (room 8). The next step would be to go east to the basement (room 7), then check if the closet is there. But the basement description says there's an exit to the west (Kitchenette) and south. Maybe the closet is in the basement. Alternatively, maybe the closet is in the Chamber or another room. 

But the user hasn't encountered a closet yet. The original instruction says to pick up the coin from the closet's floor. So the user needs to find the closet. 

Looking at the rooms visited so far: Spare Room (east), Attic (south), Steam Room (south), Bedchamber (west), Chamber (north), Kitchenette (east), Basement (south), and back to Kitchenette (west). 

Perhaps the closet is in the basement. The user is in the Kitchenette (room 8), so going east would take them to the basement (room 7). Then, in the basement, they can check if there's a closet. Alternatively, maybe the closet is in the Chamber or another room. 

But the user's next move should be to go east from the Kitchenette (room 8) to the basement (room 7), then check for the closet. However, the user's last action was going west from the basement to the Kitchenette. So the next step is to go east again to the basement. 

But the user is in the Kitchenette (room 8), and the next action would be to go east to the basement (room 7). Then, in the basement, check if there's a closet. If not, maybe go south from the basement. But the basement's description says there's an exit to the west (Kitchenette) and south. 

Alternatively, maybe the closet is in the Steam Room or another room. But the user hasn't checked those yet. 

Given the original plan, after moving north, the user was supposed to go east, then south, then south. But the user is now in the Kitchenette again. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the Kitchenette to the basement, then check for the closet. 

So the next action should be to go east from the Kitchenette (room 8) to the basement (room 7). Then, in the basement, check if the closet is there. If not, proceed further. 

But the user's last move was going west from the basement to the Kitchenette. So the next step is to go east again to the basement. Therefore, the next command is "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game, following a pattern of directions. The original goal was to venture east, then south, then west, north, east again, south, and finally pick up the coin from the closet. So far, the user has gone through the Spare Room, Attic, Steam Room, Bedchamber, Chamber, Kitchenette, Basement, and back to Kitchenette and Basement again.

The current room is the Basement, and the user is told to go south or west. The user has been alternating between going east and west, but maybe they need to find the closet where the coin is. The user's last action was going east again, which led them back to the Basement. Now, they need to check if they're getting closer to the closet. Since the original instructions mention the closet, maybe the coin is in a room that's been visited before, like the Spare Room or another area. However, the user hasn't picked up the coin yet. The next step might be to check the closet in the current room or move towards a room that has a closet. Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the Kitchenette or another room. But the user hasn't found it yet. The next action should be to check the closet or move towards it. However, the current room is the Basement, so maybe the closet is in the Kitchenette or another adjacent room. The user needs to explore further. Since the user is in the Basement, the next step is to go south as suggested, which might lead to another room. Alternatively, going west might lead back to the Kitchenette. But the user needs to find the coin. The original instruction says to pick up the coin from the floor of the closet. So the user needs to find a closet and pick up the coin. The user might need to check the current room for a closet. If not, move to a room that has a closet. The user's next action should be to go south to explore further.

So maybe the user needs to explore the Cubicle's exits. The Cubicle has a north and south exit. The user was previously in the basement, then the cubicle. If they go north from the Cubicle, they might return to the kitchenette or another room. But the original plan was to go north after the basement steps. However, the user is now in the Cubicle, which is room 10. The next step in the original plan was to go north, but the user might need to check if the closet is in the Cubicle or another room. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go south from the Cubicle to reach the basement again, but that's where they came from. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the Cubicle to reach the kitchenette again. But the original plan was to go north after the basement steps. However, the user's current position is the Cubicle, and the next step in the original instructions was to go north. But the user might need to check if the closet is in the Cubicle. Since the Cubicle is described as oddly familiar, maybe it's the closet. But the description says it's an ordinary cubicle. The coin is in the closet's floor. So maybe the user needs to look for a closet in the Cubicle. But the user's next action is to go north or south. The original instructions said to go north after the basement steps. So the user should go north from the Cubicle. But the user is in the Cubicle, and the next action is to go north. However, the user's previous steps have them moving back and forth between rooms. The original goal might be to reach the closet. So perhaps the user needs to explore the Cubicle's north exit. The user's next action should be to go north, as per the original plan. But the user is in the Cubicle, which is room 10. The original plan's next step was to go north. So the correct action is to go north.

You've entered a basement.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is navigating through different rooms in a text-based game. Their goal is to follow a series of directions: go east, south, south, west, north, east, south, south, then pick up a coin from a closet.

So far, the user has moved through the Spare Room, Attic, Steam Room, Bedchamber, Chamber, Kitchenette, Basement, and back to the Kitchenette and Basement again. The current room is the Basement again, and the next step is to go south. But the user is at the Basement again, and the previous steps have led them in a loop between the Kitchenette and Basement.

The user's next action is to go south from the Basement. The goal is to reach the closet where the coin is. However, the path seems to be cycling between rooms. The user might need to check if the closet is in a different area. But according to the previous steps, the user hasn't encountered a closet yet. The original instruction was to pick up the coin from the closet after reaching the south direction.

Wait, the user's path has been going back and forth between the Kitchenette and Basement. The original plan was to go east, south, south, west, north, east, south, south. Maybe the user is getting stuck in a loop. The next step after the Basement is to go south, which would lead to the Cubicle again. But the user needs to find the closet. Maybe the closet is in the Cubicle or another room. However, the user hasn't found it yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to explore other directions. But according to the instructions, the user should follow the sequence: east, south, south, west, north, east, south, south. So after going south from the Basement (step 11), the next step would be to go west, but the user is at the Basement again. Wait, the user's last action was go south from the Basement (step 11), which led to the Cubicle. Then, the next step would be to go north again. But the user is supposed to go south again. Hmm, maybe the user is following the correct path but getting stuck in a loop.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check if the closet is in the Cubicle. The Cubicle is described as oddly familiar, so maybe that's where the closet is. The user needs to look for a closet in the Cubicle. But the user hasn't picked up the coin yet. So the next step after going south from the Basement (step 11) would be to go north to the Cubicle, then look for the closet. But according to the original instructions, after reaching the south, the user should pick up the coin from the closet. So perhaps the user needs to go to the Cubicle, find the closet, and pick up the coin.

But the user's next action is to go south from the Basement (step 11), which leads to the Cubicle. Then, the user would need to check the Cubicle for the closet. However, the user's next action is to go north again. Wait, the user's last action was go south from the Basement (step 11), which is the 11th step. The original instructions mention going south multiple times, so maybe the user is on the right track. The next step after the Cubicle would be to go north again, but the user needs to find the closet. So the correct next action is to go north to the Cubicle, then look for the closet. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the user is supposed to follow the sequence of directions, so after going south from the Basement (step 11), the next step would be to go north to the Cubicle, then maybe go east or west to find the closet. But the user's next action is to go north again, which would take them back to the Basement. Wait, no. The user is in the Cubicle after going south from the Basement. So the next action would be to go north to the Basement again, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, the user needs to explore the Cubicle for the closet. But the user hasn't found it yet. So the correct next action is to go north to the Cubicle, then look for the closet. However, the user's next action is to go north again, which is the step after the Cubicle. But the user hasn't picked up the coin yet. So the user needs to check the Cubicle for the closet. Therefore, the next action is to go north to the Cubicle, then look for the closet. But according to the user's previous steps, they are in the Cubicle now. So the next action is to go north again, but that would take them back to the Basement. Wait, no. The user is in the Cubicle, and the previous step was going south from the Basement. So the Cubicle is north of the Basement. Therefore, the user is in the Cubicle, and the next action would be to go north to the Basement, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, the user needs to look for the closet in the Cubicle. But the user hasn't found it yet. So the correct next action is to look for the closet in the Cubicle. However, the user's instructions are to follow the directions, so after going south from the Basement (step 11), the next step is to go north to the Cubicle, then maybe go east or west to find the closet. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to go north to the Cubicle, then check for the closet. But the user is supposed to follow the sequence of directions, so after the south steps, the user should go west, north, east, south, south. But the user is at the Cubicle now. Therefore, the next action is to go north again, but that would take them back to the Basement. Hmm, this is confusing. The user's goal is to pick up the coin from the closet. The user hasn't found the closet yet. So the correct next action is to check the Cubicle for the closet. But the user hasn't done that yet. Therefore, the next action is to go north to the Cubicle, then look for the closet. However, the user's next action is to go north again, which is the step after the Cubicle. But the user is already in the Cubicle. So the next action is to go north to the Basement again. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, the user needs to explore the Cubicle. The user's next action is to go north again, which is the step after the Cubicle. But the user is in the Cubicle, so the next action would be to go north to the Basement. But that's not helpful.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Basement again, and they tried to go north but couldn't. The previous steps had them moving through various rooms: Spare Room, Attic, Steam Room, Bedchamber, Chamber, Kitchenette, Basement, and back to Kitchenette. The goal was to follow a specific path: east, south, south, west, north, east, south, then pick up the coin in the closet.

Now, in the Basement, the available exits are south and west. The user tried going north but it's blocked. So the next possible moves are south or west. Since the original plan was to go south after some steps, maybe the user needs to continue moving south from here. But the user's last action was go north, which failed. So the next action should be to try going south again. Alternatively, maybe west, but the original path had them going west once before. However, the user needs to follow the original instructions: after moving north, take east, then south, then south again, then pick up the coin.

Wait, the original instructions said: after moving north, take east, then south, then south, then pick up the coin. So maybe after the Basement, the user needs to go south to reach the Cubicle again, then proceed further. But in the current state, the user is in the Basement, and the available exits are south and west. Since the user was trying to follow the path, maybe the next step is to go south again. But the user tried going north and it's blocked, so the next possible action is south. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user was in the Cubicle (0/10), then went north to Basement (0/11). Then tried north again, which is blocked. So now, in the Basement, the user can't go north. The available exits are south and west. The original plan was to go south after some steps. So maybe the user should go south from here. But the user's next action should be to go south. However, the user's previous action was go north, which was invalid. So the correct next step is to go south. Alternatively, maybe west. But the original path had them go west once. However, the user needs to follow the sequence: after moving north, take east, then south, then south again. So perhaps from the Basement, going south would lead to the Cubicle again, then proceed east. But the user is in the Basement, so going south would take them to the Cubicle. Then from there, they can go east. But the user's last action was in the Basement, so the next action should be to go south. But the user is at Basement (0/12), and the available exits are south and west. The user needs to proceed towards the direction that follows the original plan. The original plan after the Basement was to go south again. So the next action is go south.

-= Cubicle =-
You find yourself in a cubicle. An ordinary kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

So far, they've moved through the Spare Room, Attic, Steam Room, Bedchamber, Chamber, Kitchenette, Basement, and back to the Kitchenette and Basement again.

The current room is the Cubicle, and the user is at step 13. The previous action was going south from the Basement to the Cubicle. Now, the user is asked to decide their next move. The available exits are north and south. The user has to continue following the original path, which included moving north from the Cubicle. But in the last step, when they tried to go north from the Basement, they couldn't. So maybe the correct path is to go south again from the Cubicle to return to the Basement, then find the coin.

But the original instructions said to pick up the coin from the closet. The user hasn't mentioned a closet yet. Maybe the coin is in the Cubicle or another room. However, the user's path has been moving between rooms, and the current room is the Cubicle. The user needs to check if the coin is here or find the right path to the closet. But according to the original instructions, after moving north, east, south, south, they should pick up the coin. So perhaps the coin is in the Cubicle or the Basement. Since the user is in the Cubicle now, maybe they need to look for the coin here. But the game's description doesn't mention a coin in the Cubicle. Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the Basement.

The user is in the Cubicle, which is step 13. The previous steps were moving between rooms, but the closet hasn't been mentioned. Maybe the closet is in the Basement or the Cubicle. Since the user is in the Cubicle, perhaps they need to check there. However, the game's description doesn't mention a coin in the Cubicle. The user might need to look for it, but the game's text doesn't indicate that.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a closet, and there's a coin on the floor. The original goal was to pick up the coin from the floor of the closet. So the next step should be to pick up the coin.

But wait, the prompt says to only output the action. The possible commands here would be things like 'take coin' or 'pick up coin'. Since the user is in the Closet room, and the coin is on the floor, the correct action is to take the coin. The previous steps led them here, so the final action is to pick up the coin. Let me make sure there's no other step needed. The user's last action was going south to the closet, so now they need to pick up the coin. The answer should be 'take coin' or 'pick up coin'. The game might expect 'take coin' as the command. So the next action is 'take coin'.
