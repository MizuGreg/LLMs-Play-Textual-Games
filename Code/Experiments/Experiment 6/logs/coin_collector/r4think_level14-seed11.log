It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to attempt to move south. With that done, attempt to go east. And then, take a trip north. Once you do that, make an effort to travel west. With that accomplished, take a trip west. Okay, and then, go to the north. And then, make an effort to move north. Then, try to travel east. After that, venture south. If you can get around to doing that, travel south. And then, go west. And then, attempt to travel west. And then, venture north. With that done, retrieve the coin from the floor of the steam room. That's it!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld, moving in specific directions as instructed. The goal mentioned is to retrieve a coin from the steam room.

So far, the user has moved south from the pantry, then east to the cookhouse, north to the office, and west to the cookery. Then they went east to the workshop. Now, they're in the workshop. The next step according to the previous instructions was to go west again, but the user is asking if they're on the right track and what the next action should be.

Looking at the current room, the workshop has exits to the east and west. The user has been moving back and forth, but they need to reach the steam room. The steam room hasn't been mentioned yet. The previous rooms were pantry, cookhouse, office, cookery, workshop. The steam room is probably another room that's not yet visited.

The user's goal is to get to the steam room's floor to retrieve the coin. So, maybe from the workshop, they need to find a path that leads to the steam room. But the current description of the workshop says there's an exit to the east and west. The user has been moving west from the cookery to the workshop. Now, in the workshop, going west would take them back to the cookery. Going east would take them back to the workshop's east side. Wait, maybe there's a different path.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to continue moving in a certain direction. The previous steps were south, east, north, west, east. The next step might be to go west again from the workshop, but that would take them back. Alternatively, maybe they need to go north from the workshop. But the workshop's description doesn't mention a north exit. Wait, the workshop's description says there's an exit to the west and east. So, maybe the user needs to go east from the workshop to another room, but the description doesn't mention that. Wait, the user's last action was going east to the workshop. So, the current room is workshop. The next step would be to check the exits again. The workshop has east and west. So, perhaps the user needs to go west again, but that would take them back to the cookery. Alternatively, maybe there's a different path.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go north from the workshop. But the workshop's description doesn't mention a north exit. Wait, the user's previous steps were moving in a pattern that might be looping. Maybe the user needs to find a different path. But according to the problem statement, the user needs to move in specific directions as per the initial instructions. The initial instructions were to move south, east, north, west, west, north, east, south, south, west, west, north, then retrieve the coin.

Wait, the initial instructions were a series of movements: south, east, north, west, west, north, east, south, south, west, west, north. Then retrieve the coin. So after the last movement, which was north, the user should be in a room where the coin is. But maybe the user hasn't reached that yet. Let me check the path again.

Starting from pantry (south), then cookhouse (east), office (north), cookery (west), workshop (east), then the next steps according to the initial instructions were to go west again (from workshop to cookery), then north (from cookery to office?), but that might not be right. Wait, the initial instructions were:

Move south, east, north, west, west, north, east, south, south, west, west, north. Then retrieve the coin.

So after the first few steps, the user is in the workshop. Then the next steps are: go west (from workshop to cookery), then north (from cookery to office?), then east (from office to cookhouse?), then south (from cookhouse to pantry?), then south again (but pantry's south is the original starting point?), then west (from pantry to...?), then west again, then north. This seems a bit confusing. Maybe the user is supposed to follow the directions step by step, even if it loops.

But the user is now in the workshop, and the next step according to the initial instructions was to go west again. But the user is asking if they're on the right track. The user might be confused if they're going in circles. However, the game's rooms might have different connections. Alternatively, maybe the steam room is in a different part of the map.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the workshop. But the workshop's description doesn't mention a north exit. Wait, the workshop's description says: "You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the west." So, the workshop has east and west exits. So, going west from the workshop would take them back to the cookery. Then, from the cookery, maybe there's a north exit to the office. But the user's initial instructions say to go north from the cookery. So, perhaps the user is following the steps correctly, but the steam room is in a different part of the map.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the workshop to another room, but the description doesn't mention that. The user might be stuck in a loop. But according to the initial instructions, the user is supposed to move in a specific sequence. The user is now in the workshop, and the next step according to the initial instructions was to go west again. So, the next action should be to go west from the workshop. But the user is asking if they're on the right track. The user might be confused if they're not getting closer to the steam room.

Alternatively, maybe the steam room is in the office or cookhouse. But the user hasn't reached that yet. The user needs to continue following the steps. The next action after the workshop would be to go west, as per the initial instructions. So the next command should be "go west".

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld, following a specific sequence of movements. The goal is to retrieve a coin from the steam room. So far, they've moved through several rooms: pantry, cookhouse, office, cookery, workshop, cubicle, bedroom, and back to cubicle again.

The user is now in the cubicle, and the next steps according to the initial instructions were to go west, north, east, south, etc. But it seems like they're stuck in a loop between the cubicle and bedroom. The problem might be that the steam room isn't in the path they're taking. Maybe they need to find a different route.

Looking at the current room, the cubicle has an exit to the east and north. The bedroom has exits to north and south. The user has been going back and forth between these two rooms. Since the initial instructions mention moving west from the workshop, which led to the cubicle, maybe the steam room is in a different direction. But the user hasn't explored other exits yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the cubicle. The cubicle has an unguarded exit to the east. If they go east, they might reach a new room that's part of the path to the steam room. The user's previous steps were following a pattern that might not be leading them directly to the steam room. They need to try a different direction, perhaps east from the cubicle.

So, the next action should be to go east from the cubicle to see if that leads them closer to the steam room. That's the logical next step since the user has been looping between cubicle and bedroom and hasn't explored the east exit yet.

The current room is the cubicle, and the exits are east and north. The workshop is to the west. The user has been going back and forth, maybe missing a path.

Since the cubicle has an exit to the east, maybe that's the direction to go. Alternatively, the workshop might have a different exit. But the workshop's description says east and west. Wait, the user just came from the workshop to the cubicle by going west. So, the cubicle's east exit might lead to a new room. Let's try going east from the cubicle. That's the next logical step after being in the cubicle again. The user might be missing that path. So, the next action should be go east.

Looking at the current room, the cubicle has an exit to the east. The user hasn't explored that direction yet. The previous steps showed that going east from the cubicle leads to the workshop, which then leads back to the cookery. But the steam room hasn't been mentioned yet. Maybe the steam room is in a different part of the map, and the user needs to find another path. 

Alternatively, the user might be stuck in a loop between the cubicle and workshop. The initial instructions mentioned moving in a specific sequence, but the user might be missing a key exit. The next step should be to try going east from the cubicle again, as that's the only other exit besides north. But the user has already done that and ended up back in the workshop. 

Wait, maybe the steam room is in the cookery or office. The user needs to check other exits. From the cookery, there's a south exit. Maybe going south from the cookery leads to the steam room. But the user hasn't tried that yet. However, the user is currently in the cubicle. So, the next step should be to go east again, but that's already been done. Alternatively, go north from the cubicle to the bedroom, then try other exits. 

But the user's last action was going west to the workshop. The next step is to go east again, but that's the same as before. Maybe the user needs to try a different direction. However, the instructions say to follow the sequence: after the last movement, go west, then north, east, south, etc. But the user is stuck in a loop. 

Perhaps the steam room is in the workshop, but the user hasn't found it yet. The workshop's description doesn't mention the coin. The user needs to check other rooms. The next possible step is to go east from the cubicle again, but that's already been done. Alternatively, go north from the cubicle to the bedroom, then try other exits. 

But the user is following the initial instructions, which might not be leading them directly to the steam room. The key is to find the correct path. The user needs to continue moving in the specified directions until they reach the steam room. The next action should be to go east from the cubicle again, even though it's looping, because that's part of the sequence. So, the next command is go east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through TextWorld to find a coin in the steam room. They've been moving around different rooms like pantry, cookhouse, office, cookery, workshop, cubicle, bedroom, and back. Now they're in the cookhouse again.

The current room is the cookhouse, and the exits mentioned are east and north. The user's goal is to reach the steam room. So far, they've gone through several rooms, but the steam room hasn't been encountered yet. The previous steps involved moving in a loop between certain rooms, but maybe there's a path through the cookhouse that leads to the steam room.

The cookhouse has an unguarded exit to the north and east. The user has been moving west from the office to the cookhouse. The next step would be to try going north from the cookhouse, as that's one of the exits mentioned. Alternatively, going east might lead to another room. But since the user is following a sequence of movements, the next action should be to go north from the cookhouse. That's the logical next step in the sequence of directions they've been following. So, the command would be "go north".

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Pantry and Cookhouse. They've been going back and forth between these two rooms, which suggests they might be missing a different path. The original goal was to retrieve the coin from the steam room, but the current path isn't leading there.

Looking at the rooms they've visited so far: pantry, cookhouse, office, cookery, workshop, cubicle, bedroom. The steam room hasn't been mentioned yet. Maybe the steam room is in a different part of the map that's not been explored yet. The user needs to find another exit or direction that hasn't been tried.

In the current scenario, the user is in the Pantry again. The only exit mentioned is south to the Cookhouse. But they've already been there. The previous steps showed that moving east from the Cookhouse leads to the Office, but that's already been visited. Maybe there's a different exit that's been overlooked. Alternatively, maybe the steam room is in the Office or another room they've passed through.

The user needs to try a different direction. Since the Cookhouse has an exit to the east and north, but the user has been going north and south between Pantry and Cookhouse, perhaps they need to go east from the Cookhouse again. But the user is currently in the Pantry, so the next step should be to go south again to the Cookhouse, then try east. However, the user is following a sequence that might not be leading them to the steam room. They need to break the loop and explore other paths. The next action should be to go east from the Cookhouse, even though it's been tried before, to see if that leads to a new room. But the user is in the Pantry now, so the next move is to go south to the Cookhouse again. But that's the same as before. Maybe the user needs to try a different direction altogether, but the available exits are limited. The answer is to continue moving in the sequence, even if it loops, until the steam room is found.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Cookery, Office, Workshop, and Cubicle. They've been moving back and forth between these rooms repeatedly. The goal is to find the steam room and retrieve the coin. So far, the steam room hasn't been encountered, which suggests that the correct path hasn't been followed yet.

Looking at the current room, Cookery, the exits are south and west. The user has been going south to the Office and then north back to Cookery. The Workshop and Cubicle are adjacent but haven't been leading to the steam room. The initial instructions mentioned moving in a specific sequence, but the user is following a loop instead.

The key might be to find a different exit that hasn't been explored. In the Cookery, there's an exit to the west. The user has been going west to the Workshop, but that path hasn't led to the steam room. Maybe the steam room is in a different direction, like east from the Cookery, but that exit is unguarded. However, the user hasn't tried going east from the Cookery yet.

Wait, the Cookery has an unguarded exit to the south and a west exit. The user has been going south to the Office and back. Maybe the steam room is in the Office or another room connected to it. But the Office has exits to the north and west. The user needs to try a different direction from the Office, like west, but that leads back to the Cookery.

Alternatively, maybe the steam room is in the Workshop or Cubicle, but those rooms haven't been checked for the coin. The user needs to explore those rooms more thoroughly. However, the current path is looping, so the next step should be to try going east from the Cookery, even though it's unguarded, to see if that leads to a new room. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next action should be to go east from the Cookery.
