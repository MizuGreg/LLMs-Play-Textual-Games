I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First stop, make an effort to head north. With that over with, recover the coin from the floor of the laundry place. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Canteen =-
Well, here we are in a canteen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Laundry Place =-
You are in a laundry place. A normal one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.
