Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to head north. With that accomplished, go to the north. Then, make an effort to go north. Then, travel east. And then, make an effort to move north. Once you succeed at that, go to the north. With that accomplished, venture west. Once you get around to doing that, move north. After that, make an attempt to venture west. Then, attempt to take a trip south. With that over with, lift the coin from the floor of the scullery. And once you've done that, you win!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game, and they've been moving around different rooms like a bar, basement, launderette, sauna, and garage. The goal is to lift the coin from the scullery and win. So far, they've been going back and forth between the sauna and garage, moving east and west.

Hmm, the user's instructions mentioned moving north, east, west, south, and eventually finding the coin. But right now, they're stuck in a loop between the sauna and garage. The current room is the sauna, and the exits are east and south. The user just tried going east again, which leads back to the garage. Then from the garage, they go west to the sauna again. It's like they're stuck in a cycle.

The user's question is whether they're on the right track and close to the goal. From the path taken, they haven't reached the scullery yet. The coin is in the scullery, which hasn't been mentioned in the rooms they've visited. So maybe the scullery is a different room that's not part of the current loop.

Looking at the rooms they've passed through: bar, basement, launderette, sauna, garage, cubicle. The scullery isn't listed here. So perhaps the scullery is another room that's connected differently. The user needs to find a way to get to the scullery. Maybe there's a path through the garage or sauna that leads to it. But in the current setup, the exits from the sauna are east (garage) and south (which is the garage again? Wait, earlier when in the sauna, the exit to the south was unblocked, but when in the garage, the exit to the south is unblocked. Maybe the scullery is connected to the garage or another room.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the garage. The garage has an exit to the north, which was mentioned earlier. If they go north from the garage, maybe that leads to the scullery. But in the current loop, they're going back and forth between sauna and garage. So perhaps they need to go north from the garage once they're there.

Wait, the user's last action was going west from the sauna to the garage again. So if they are in the garage, they can go north. Let me check the previous steps. When in the garage, the exit to the north is unblocked. So if they go north from the garage, that's a possible path. But in the current loop, they keep going west and east, not taking that north exit.

So maybe the user needs to go north from the garage once they're there. But they've been stuck in the loop. So the next step would be, when in the garage, go north. But the user hasn't done that yet. So perhaps the correct path is to go north from the garage to reach the scullery, then pick up the coin.

But the user's current position is in the sauna, so they need to go to the garage first, then north. But they keep going back and forth. So the next action should be to go north from the garage. But the user is in the sauna, so they need to go east to the garage, then north. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to go east from the sauna to the garage, then north. But the user is currently in the sauna, so the next action is go east to the garage. Then from the garage, go north. That would be the correct path.

But the user's last action was go west from the sauna to the garage again. So the next step is to go north from the garage. So the answer should be go north.

Okay, the user is stuck in the Sauna room, trying to go north but can't. They've been looping between the Sauna and Garage, moving east and west. The goal is to lift the coin from the scullery. So far, they haven't reached the scullery. The Sauna's exits are east (Garage) and south (which is the Garage again). The Garage has an exit to the north, which might be the path to the scullery. But the user keeps going back and forth without taking the north exit from the Garage.

But the user is currently in the Sauna, so they need to go east to the Garage first, then north. However, the user has been stuck in the loop, not taking that step. The user's last action was trying to go north from the Sauna, which isn't possible. So the correct next step is to go east from the Sauna to the Garage, then north from the Garage.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is in the Scullery and there's a coin on the floor. They tried "lift coin" and "lift the coin", but the game didn't recognize it. The correct command should be "pick up coin" or "take coin". Since the user is following the game's instructions, they need to use the exact phrase. The goal is to lift the coin and win, so the next action is to pick up the coin correctly.
</think>pick up coin
