Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, make an effort to venture south. With that done, go to the south. Once you do that, make an attempt to move west. And then, travel south. And then, try to head south. Once you succeed at that, try to travel east. Then, make an attempt to venture east. Then, recover the coin from the floor of the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!
