Welcome to another life changing session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, head north. With that accomplished, go to the north. Then, make an effort to go north. Then, travel east. And then, pick up the coin from the floor of the garage. Got that? Good!

-= Salon =-
You've just sauntered into a salon.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

-= Chamber =-
You arrive in a chamber. A standard one.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Sauna =-
You've entered a sauna.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been moving through different rooms: Salon, Study, Chamber, and now Sauna. The goal seems to be to reach the original goal, which might be escaping or finding something, given the context of the previous rooms and the hints about exits.

In the Sauna room, the user is told there's an unblocked exit to the east and an unguarded exit to the south. The previous actions were all going north, but now they're in a sauna. The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal.

Hmm, the previous rooms were all part of a sequence that might be leading to a specific exit. The Salon, Study, Chamber, Sauna—each with different exit directions. The user has been going north each time, which worked until the Sauna. Now, in the Sauna, the exits are east and south. The user needs to choose between those. 

The original goal might be to reach a specific location, maybe the exit. Since the Sauna has an unblocked exit to the east, that might be a good direction. But the user is also told to check if they're close. The previous rooms were part of a path that might lead to the exit. However, the user is now in the Sauna, which is a different room. 

Wait, in the Chamber, the exit to the north was unguarded, and the user went north again. Then in the Sauna, the east is unblocked. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the Sauna. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from the Sauna to continue the sequence. But the user is asking if they're close. 

The user might be on the right track, but perhaps they need to take a different direction. Since the Sauna has an unblocked exit to the east, that's a possible path. The user should go east. Alternatively, if the goal is to reach the original exit, maybe the correct direction is east. But I need to check the previous steps. 

In the Chamber, the user went north, which led to the Sauna. So maybe the next step is to go east from the Sauna. The user is asking if they're close, so maybe they are. The next action would be to go east.
</think>go east

-= Garage =-
You arrive in a garage. A normal one. You start to take note of what's in the room.



There is an unblocked exit to the west.

There is a coin on the floor.
