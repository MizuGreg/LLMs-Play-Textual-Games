Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Your first objective is to go to the east. Following that, attempt to go south. After that, take a trip east. Then, attempt to move east. Okay, and then, make an attempt to go north. Once you manage that, make an attempt to go to the north. After that, move east. Then, venture north. Then, take a trip west. With that accomplished, retrieve the coin from the floor of the cookhouse. Alright, thanks!

You're now in the study.



There is an unguarded exit to the east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has a specific sequence of moves to follow. The current location is the Cubicle. The original goal was to reach the cookhouse and get the coin, but the user is following a path that involves moving in certain directions.

First, the user's current position is the Cubicle. The study's east exit led here. The Cubicle has a south and west direction mentioned. The user's next step in the original plan was to go south after the first east. But the user's previous action was going east from the study, which led to the cubicle. Now, the prompt says to try going south from the cubicle. The user's next action should be "go south" as per the initial instructions. The user is supposed to follow the sequence: east, south, east, east, north, north, east, north, west, then get the coin. So after the cubicle, going south would be the next step. The user needs to make sure they follow the path correctly. The answer should just be the command "go south".

You arrive in an office. A typical one.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an unguarded exit to the north.

Okay, let me try to figure out the best next move here. The user's original goal was to go east, then south, east again, east again, north, north again, east, north, west, and finally get the coin from the cookhouse. So far, they've gone from the study to the cubicle (west?), then to the office. Wait, the first move was go east from the study, which took them to the cubicle. Then they went south from the cubicle to the office. Now, in the office, there's an unblocked exit to the east and an unguarded exit to the north.

Looking at the path they've taken: Study → Cubicle → Office. The original plan was to go east, then south, then east, etc. But after the first east, they went south. Now, in the office, the next step according to the original plan would be to go east again. But the user's next action was go south, which took them to the office. Now, from the office, the next step in the original plan was after going south (from cubicle to office) to take a trip east. So maybe from the office, they should go east again. But the office has an exit to the east and north. The original plan after the office would be to move east again. So the next action should be go east. But wait, the user's current location is the office. The original plan after the office would be to move east again. So the next command should be go east. But let me check the original steps again.

Original steps: go east (Study → Cubicle), then go south (Cubicle → Office), then take a trip east (so from Office, go east?), then attempt to move east again, then north, etc. So from the office, the next step is to go east. So the next action should be go east. But the office has an exit to the east and north. So the user should go east. But the user's next action was go south, which took them to the office. Now, in the office, the next step is to go east. So the answer is go east.

You arrive in an attic. An ordinary kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has a specific path they need to follow. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far.

Starting in the Study, they went East to the Cubicle, then South to the Office, then East again to the Attic. The original goal was to go east, then south, then east, then east again, then north, then north, then east, then north, then west, and finally get the coin from the cookhouse. 

Currently, they're in the Attic. The next steps according to the original plan after the Attic would be to try moving East again. The Attic's description mentions unblocked exits to East and West. Since the user has been moving East repeatedly, maybe the next logical step is to go East again. But wait, the user's plan after the Attic is to venture north. Wait, let me check the original instructions again.

Original steps: After the Attic, the next was "Then, venture north." So after the Attic, they need to go North. But the Attic's exits are East and West. So maybe the user needs to go North from the Attic. But the current room (Attic) doesn't have a North exit mentioned. The description says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west." So maybe the Attic's exits are only East and West. Therefore, the user's plan might have a mistake here. Wait, the original plan said after the Attic, venture north. But if the Attic doesn't have a North exit, maybe that's a problem. Alternatively, perhaps the user is supposed to go East from the Attic, then from there, maybe the next room has a North exit.

Wait, the user's original plan was: After the Attic, venture north. But if the Attic's exits are only East and West, then how to get North? Maybe the user made a mistake in the plan. Alternatively, maybe the Attic has a North exit that's not mentioned. But according to the current room description, the exits are East and West. So perhaps the user needs to go East from the Attic, then from the next room (maybe the next room is the Kitchen or something else), then go North. But the user's plan says after the Attic, venture north. So maybe the user is supposed to go North from the Attic, but that's not possible. Therefore, perhaps the user's plan has an error. However, the user is following the steps as given. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go East from the Attic, then from there, go North. Let me check the original steps again. The original steps were: After the Attic, venture north. So maybe the user is supposed to go North from the Attic. But the Attic's description doesn't mention a North exit. Therefore, perhaps the user's plan is incorrect. However, the user is following the steps as per the initial instructions. 

Wait, maybe the user is supposed to go East again from the Attic, then from the next room, go North. Let me think. The user's current position is the Attic. The next step in the original plan is to venture north. But since the Attic doesn't have a North exit, perhaps the user needs to go East first, then from the next room, go North. So the correct next step would be to go East from the Attic. Then, from the next room (maybe the Kitchen?), go North. But the user's plan says after the Attic, venture north. So maybe the user is supposed to go North from the Attic, but that's not possible. Therefore, the user might have made a mistake in the plan. However, the user is following the steps as given. 

Alternatively, maybe the Attic has a North exit that's not mentioned. But according to the current description, the exits are East and West. Therefore, the user's next action should be to go East again. Then, from the next room, perhaps there's a North exit. So the user's next action is to go East. That's what the user did in the previous steps. So the answer here is to go East again. But the original plan said after the Attic, venture north. So maybe the user is confused. But according to the current room's description, the exits are East and West. So the correct next step is to go East again. Therefore, the answer is "go east".

-= Recreation Zone =-
You are in a recreation zone. A normal kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in this text-based game. Their goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements: go east, then south, then east again, then east again, then north, then north again, then east, then north, then west, and finally retrieve a coin from the cookhouse.

So far, the user has moved from the study to the cubicle, then to the office, attic, and recreation zone. Each time, they've been told that certain directions are unblocked. The current location is the recreation zone. The next step in their plan is to go north. But the prompt here says that in the recreation zone, going north is unblocked, and there's an exit to the west which is also unblocked. 

The user's next action should be to go north, as per their original plan. They need to continue moving in the specified directions to reach the cookhouse and get the coin. Since the recreation zone's north is unblocked, "go north" is the correct command here. I need to make sure I only output the command without any extra text.

-= Dish-Pit =-
You find yourself in a dish-pit. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Dish-Pit =-0/6

Their goal is to follow a specific sequence of movements: go east, then south, then east again, then east again, then north, then north again, then east, then north, then west, and finally retrieve a coin from the cookhouse.

So far, the user has moved from the Study to the Cubicle, then to the Office, Attic, Recreation Zone, and now the Dish-Pit. The current room is the Dish-Pit, and the next steps in the original plan are to go north again, then north again, then east, then north, then west, and finally get the coin.

In the Dish-Pit, the hints say to try going north or south for an unguarded exit. The user's next action should be to go north as per the original plan. The user has already gone north once here (from Recreation Zone to Dish-Pit), so maybe another north would take them to the next area. After that, they need to go north again, then east, then north, then west. Then, once in the cookhouse, retrieve the coin.

So the next command should be 'go north' again to continue the sequence. The user is following the planned path, so sticking to that makes sense. The answer is 'go north'.

Okay, let's see. The user is navigating through different rooms in a text-based game. Their goal is to reach the cookhouse floor to retrieve a coin. So far, they've gone from the study to the cubicle, then to the office, attic, recreation zone, dish-pit, and now the playroom.

In the playroom, the options are to go east or south. The original plan was to go east, then south, then east again, and so on. But the user has been following the path of going east whenever possible. However, in the playroom, the southern exit is unguarded. The original goal mentioned moving east, then south, then east, etc. But the user might need to check if the southern exit leads them closer to the cookhouse.

Wait, the cookhouse is mentioned as a floor where the coin is located. The user has been moving through different areas, but maybe the cookhouse is in a different part. The current room is the playroom. The southern exit might be a better direction to head towards the cookhouse. Alternatively, the east exit could lead to another area. But the user's previous steps have been to go east whenever possible. However, the original instructions said after moving east, attempt to go south. So maybe after the playroom, the next step is to go south. But the user's last action was going north to get here. So in the playroom, the next step should be to go south as per the original plan. Let me check the original instructions again.

Original plan: Go east, then south, then east, then east again, then north, then north, then east, then north, then west, then retrieve the coin from the cookhouse. So after the playroom, the next step would be to go south. The user is in the playroom, and the southern exit is unguarded. So the correct next action is to go south.

Okay, let's see. The user is navigating through different rooms in a text-based game. Their goal is to reach the cookhouse and retrieve the coin. So far, they've moved from the study east to the cubicle, then south to the office, east to the attic, east again to the recreation zone, north to the dish-pit, then north again to the playroom, and south back to the dish-pit.

The current room is the dish-pit again. The prompt says there's an unguarded exit to the north and south. The user's next action should be to continue moving towards the cookhouse. Since they've been moving east and north, maybe the cookhouse is in a different direction. But the user's original plan was to go east, then south, east, east, north, north, east, north, west, and then get the coin. But they might be stuck in a loop between the dish-pit and playroom.

Wait, the user is at the dish-pit (room 8). The previous step was going south from the playroom to the dish-pit. Now, the options are north or south. The user needs to get to the cookhouse. Maybe the cookhouse is in the west direction from the dish-pit? But the current room's description doesn't mention west. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the playroom or another area. But the user's plan was to go west after reaching the cookhouse. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the dish-pit to the playroom again, then east to the recreation zone, and so on. But the user's goal is to get to the cookhouse. Since the cookhouse is mentioned in the original instruction, perhaps it's in a different part of the map. The user might need to explore more rooms. However, the current room's exits are only north and south. Since they're stuck in a loop, maybe the correct path is to go north again to the playroom, then east to the recreation zone, then north to the dish-pit again. But that doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the west direction from the dish-pit. But the current room's description doesn't mention a west exit. Wait, the user's original plan was to go west after reaching the cookhouse. So perhaps the cookhouse is in a room that has a west exit. But the user is currently in the dish-pit, which has exits to north and south. Maybe the cookhouse is in the south direction from the dish-pit. Let me check the previous steps.

The user was in the playroom (room 7), then went south to the dish-pit (room 8). The playroom's description said there's an exit to the south (unguarded). So from the dish-pit, going south would take them back to the playroom? Wait, no. Wait, the dish-pit's exits are north and south. If they go south from the dish-pit, they would go back to the playroom. But the user is already there. So maybe the cookhouse is in the north direction from the dish-pit. But the playroom is north of the dish-pit. The playroom is room 7, dish-pit is room 8. So going north from dish-pit (room 8) would take them to the playroom (room 7). But that's where they came from. So maybe the cookhouse is in another direction. But the user hasn't found it yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the playroom (room 7) to the recreation zone (room 5), then north to the dish-pit (room 8), then east to the attic (room 4), then east to the office (room 3), then east to the cubicle (room 2), then east to the study (room 1). But that's the original path. The user's goal is to get to the cookhouse, which is probably in a different area. Maybe the cookhouse is in the west direction from the dish-pit. But the current room's description doesn't mention west. So perhaps the user needs to find another way.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the playroom (room 7) to the dish-pit (room 8), but that's already been done. Hmm. The user's original plan was to go east, south, east, east, north, north, east, north, west. But they're stuck in the dish-pit. Maybe the correct path is to go north from the dish-pit (room 8) to the playroom (room 7), then east to the recreation zone (room 5), then north to the dish-pit again. This seems like a loop. Maybe the user needs to find another exit. But the current room only has north and south. So perhaps the user is supposed to go south from the dish-pit (room 8) back to the playroom (room 7), then east to the recreation zone (room 5), then north to the dish-pit again. This is a loop, so maybe the user is not on the right path.

Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the playroom (room 7). The user's original plan was to go west after retrieving the coin. But the user hasn't found the coin yet. The coin is in the cookhouse. So the user needs to reach the cookhouse. Maybe the cookhouse is in the playroom. But the playroom's description doesn't mention a coin. Alternatively, the cookhouse is in the dish-pit. The user is in the dish-pit (room 8), and the coin is there. But the user hasn't found it yet. The user's instruction says to retrieve the coin from the floor of the cookhouse. So the cookhouse is a different room. Maybe the cookhouse is in the playroom or another area.

Alternatively, the user might need to go west from the dish-pit. But the current room's description doesn't mention a west exit. So perhaps the user is stuck. But according to the game's rules, the user can only move in the directions mentioned. The current room (dish-pit) has exits to north and south. So the user's next action should be to go north or south. The user's original plan was to go west after reaching the cookhouse, but they haven't reached it yet. So maybe the user needs to continue moving in the current directions until they find the cookhouse.

Since the user is in the dish-pit (room 8), and the previous steps were going south to get here, the next logical step is to go north back to the playroom (room 7), then east to the recreation zone (room 5), then north to the dish-pit again. This seems like a loop, but maybe the cookhouse is in another part of the map. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from the dish-pit (room 8) back to the playroom (room 7), then east to the recreation zone (room 5), then north to the dish-pit again. This is not helpful. 

Wait, the user's original plan was to go east, then south, then east, then east, then north, then north, then east, then north, then west. But they are currently in the dish-pit (room 8). The next step in the original plan was to go west after reaching the cookhouse. But the user hasn't reached the cookhouse yet. So maybe the user needs to continue moving in the current directions. The user's next action should be to go north from the dish-pit (room 8) to the playroom (room 7), then east to the recreation zone (room 5), then north to the dish-pit again. This seems like a loop, but maybe the cookhouse is in the playroom. However, the playroom's description doesn't mention a coin. Alternatively, the cookhouse is in the recreation zone. 

But according to the game's current state, the user is in the dish-pit (room 8), and the next action is to go north or south. The user's original plan was to go west after reaching the cookhouse. So perhaps the user needs to find the cookhouse first. Since the user is in the dish-pit, maybe the cookhouse is in the south direction. But the user is in the dish-pit, and going south would take them back to the playroom. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the dish-pit. But the current room's description says to try going east or west. Wait, the dish-pit's description says: "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south." So no east or west exits. So the user can only go north or south. 

So the user's next action is to go north or south. The user's original plan was to go east, then south, then east, then east, then north, then north, then east, then north, then west. But they are stuck in the dish-pit. Maybe the user needs to go north again to the playroom (room 7), then east to the recreation zone (room 5), then north to the dish-pit again. This is a loop, but maybe the cookhouse is in the playroom. However, the playroom's description doesn't mention a coin. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from the dish-pit (room 8) back to the playroom (room 7), then east to the recreation zone (room 5), then north to the dish-pit again. This is not helpful. 

Wait, the user's original goal was to retrieve the coin from the cookhouse. The cookhouse is probably a different room. The user hasn't found it yet. So maybe the user needs to continue exploring. The user is in the dish-pit, and the next step is to go north to the playroom. Then, from the playroom, go east to the recreation zone. Then, from there, go north to the dish-pit again. This is a loop. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east from the playroom (room 7) to the recreation zone (room 5), then north to the dish-pit (room 8), then east to the attic (room 4), then east to the office (room 3), then east to the cubicle (room 2), then east to the study (room 1). But that's the original path. 

I think the user is stuck in a loop between the dish-pit and playroom. The next action should be to go north from the dish-pit to the playroom again. Then, from the playroom, go east to the recreation zone. Then, from there, go north to the dish-pit again. This seems like the only possible path. But the user hasn't found the cookhouse yet. 

Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the playroom. The user needs to check the playroom for the coin. But the playroom's description doesn't mention a coin. 

Given the current state, the user's next action should be to go north from the dish-pit to the playroom. So the answer is "go north".

-= Playroom =-
You find yourself in a playroom. An ordinary kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is navigating through different rooms in a text-based game. Their goal is to reach the cookhouse floor to retrieve a coin. So far, they've moved from the study, through a cubicle, office, attic, recreation zone, dish-pit, playroom, and back to the dish-pit again.

The current room is the playroom. The instructions mention that after moving north from the dish-pit, they ended up in the playroom. The user's next action should be to go east, as the playroom has an unblocked exit to the east. But wait, the user's original plan was to go east, then south, then east again, then north, etc. Let me check the sequence again.

Original plan: Go east (study → cubicle), then south (cubicle → office), then east (office → attic), then east (attic → recreation zone), then north (recreation zone → dish-pit), then north (dish-pit → playroom), then south (playroom → dish-pit again). Hmm, maybe they're stuck in a loop between dish-pit and playroom. The user's next step should be to go east from the playroom, as per the current room's description. The playroom has an exit to the east that's unblocked. So the next command should be "go east".

-= Bedroom =-
You have fallen into the most ordinary of all possible bedrooms. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Okay, let's see. The user is navigating through different rooms in a text-based game. Their goal is to reach the cookhouse floor to retrieve the coin. So far, they've moved through the study, cubicle, office, attic, recreation zone, dish-pit, playroom, and now the bedroom. The current room is the bedroom, which has an unblocked exit to the north and a west exit that's unguarded.

The user's original plan was to go east, then south, then east again, then east again, then north, then north again, then east, then north, then west, and finally get the coin from the cookhouse. But the path seems a bit repetitive, moving back and forth between rooms. 

Now, in the bedroom, the options are north or west. The user's next step should be to check if moving north takes them closer to the cookhouse. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in a different direction. But since the previous steps have been moving east and north, perhaps the cookhouse is in the north direction. However, the user needs to reach the cookhouse floor, which might be a specific room. 

But the current room is the bedroom. The user's next action should be to go north, as that's the unblocked exit mentioned. Alternatively, maybe west could lead to another path. However, the original plan was to move north after reaching the playroom. But the user has already been moving north and south multiple times. 

Wait, the user's goal is to get to the cookhouse floor. The cookhouse is probably a specific room. The user might need to find the correct path. Since the current room is the bedroom, and the exit to the north is unblocked, going north seems like the right move. The user should continue moving north to reach the cookhouse. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in the west direction from the bedroom. But the user's previous steps have been moving east and north, so perhaps the cookhouse is in the north direction. 

But the user's next action should be to go north, as that's the direction mentioned. So the answer is go north.

-= Laundry Place =-
Look at you, bigshot, walking into a laundry place like it isn't some huge deal.



There is an unguarded exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

The current room is the Laundry Place. The prompt mentions an unguarded exit to the south and suggests going west. The user's previous actions have been following the pattern of moving east, then south, north, etc., as per the initial instructions. But now, in the Laundry Place, the options are south and west. 

The original plan was to go east, then south, east, east, north, north, east, north, west, and then get the coin. But the user is now in the Laundry Place. The next step according to the initial instructions was to move west after reaching the Laundry Place. However, the user's last action was going north to get here. The prompt says to try going west. So the next logical step would be to go west. But wait, the user's goal is to get to the cookhouse. Maybe the cookhouse is in a different direction. But according to the current room's description, the unguarded exit is south. However, the user is told to try west. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check if moving south is possible. But the instruction here says to try west. The user's previous actions have been following the directions given in each room's description. So in the Laundry Place, the suggestion is to go west. Therefore, the next action should be go west.

-= Cookhouse =-
You are in a cookhouse. An ordinary one.



There is an unguarded exit to the east.

There is a coin on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal was to retrieve the coin from the cookhouse. The current location is the Cookhouse, and there's a coin on the floor. The previous actions have led them here, and the next step should be to pick up the coin.

The user's last action was going west, which brought them to the Cookhouse. Now, the coin is present here. The instruction says to retrieve the coin from the floor of the cookhouse. So the correct action is to pick up the coin. The game might require using a command like 'take coin' or 'get coin'. Since the user has been using directional commands like 'go north', 'go east', etc., the next step here is to interact with the coin. The exact command would be to take the coin. Therefore, the answer should be 'take coin'.
