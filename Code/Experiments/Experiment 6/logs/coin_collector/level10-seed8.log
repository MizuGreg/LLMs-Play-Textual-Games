Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Your first objective is to go to the east. Following that, attempt to go south. After that, take a trip east. Then, attempt to move east. Okay, and then, make an attempt to go north. Once you manage that, make an attempt to go to the north. After that, move east. Then, venture north. Then, take a trip west. With that accomplished, retrieve the coin from the floor of the cookhouse. Alright, thanks!

You're now in the study.



There is an unguarded exit to the east.

Okay, let me try to figure out what the next step should be. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game: study, cubicle, office. The original goal was to go east, then south, east, east, north, north, east, north, west, and then get the coin from the cookhouse.

So far, the path taken is: Study → East → Cubicle → South → Office. Now in the Office, the exits are east and north. The next steps in the original plan after the Office would be to move east again. Wait, the user's original instructions said after getting to the office, they should move east, then venture north, then west, etc. Let me check the original sequence again.

Original steps:
1. Go east (from study)
2. Go south (from cubicle)
3. Go east (from office? Or maybe from another location? Wait, the user's instructions were: after the first east, then south, then east again. Then attempt to move east again. Then north, then north again, then east, then north, then west. Then get the coin.

So after the Office, the next step according to the original plan is to move east. Because in the Office, the user is supposed to go east. Then from there, venture north. So the next action should be to go east from the Office. The user is currently in the Office, and the exits are east and north. So the next command should be "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is following a specific path through the game. The original goal was to navigate through various directions, ending up in the cookhouse to get the coin. So far, the path taken is Study → East (Cubicle) → South (Office) → East (Attic) → North (Recreation Zone) → North (Dish-Pit). Now, in the Dish-Pit, the exits are north and south.

The next step according to the original plan was to venture north after moving east in the Recreation Zone. But the user is now in the Dish-Pit. The original instructions mentioned after the Recreation Zone, they should go north to the Dish-Pit. Then, from there, the next step was to take a trip west. Wait, the original steps after the Dish-Pit weren't fully tracked. Let me check again.

Original steps after reaching the Dish-Pit: The user was supposed to move west. But in the Dish-Pit, the exits are north and south. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. The user's original plan said after the Recreation Zone (which is north of the Dish-Pit), they should venture north. But the user is now in the Dish-Pit. The next step in the original plan was to move west. However, in the Dish-Pit, the exits are north and south. So perhaps the user needs to go west from the Dish-Pit. But the current room is the Dish-Pit, and the exits are north and south. Wait, maybe the user is supposed to go south from the Dish-Pit to reach the cookhouse. Alternatively, maybe there's a confusion in the directions.

Wait, the original plan said: After the Dish-Pit, the next step was to take a trip west. But in the Dish-Pit, the exits are north and south. So maybe the user is supposed to go south from the Dish-Pit. Alternatively, perhaps the user is supposed to go west from the Recreation Zone, but that's not possible. Let me retrace the steps.

Original steps:

1. Study → East (Cubicle)
2. Cubicle → South (Office)
3. Office → East (Attic)
4. Attic → North (Recreation Zone)
5. Recreation Zone → North (Dish-Pit)
6. Now, from Dish-Pit, the next step was to take a trip west. But in the Dish-Pit, the exits are north and south. So maybe the user is supposed to go south from the Dish-Pit. But according to the original plan, after the Dish-Pit, the next step was to move west. However, in the current room (Dish-Pit), the exits are north and south. So perhaps there's a mistake in the original plan, or maybe the user needs to go south from the Dish-Pit to reach the cookhouse. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Recreation Zone, but that's not possible. Wait, in the Recreation Zone, the exits are north and west. So from Recreation Zone, going west would be the next step. But the user was supposed to go north from Recreation Zone to Dish-Pit. So maybe the original plan had a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the user is supposed to go west from the Dish-Pit. But in the Dish-Pit, the exits are north and south. Therefore, maybe the user is supposed to go south from the Dish-Pit. But the original plan said after the Dish-Pit, move west. So perhaps the user is in the wrong place. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Recreation Zone. But the user was in the Recreation Zone and went north to Dish-Pit. So perhaps the next step is to go south from Dish-Pit. But the original plan said after the Dish-Pit, move west. So maybe there's a confusion here. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Dish-Pit, but that's not possible. Therefore, the correct next step is to go south from the Dish-Pit. But the original plan said to move west. So perhaps the user is supposed to go south. But the original plan might have an error. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go west from the Recreation Zone. But the user went north from Recreation Zone to Dish-Pit. Therefore, the next step is to go south from Dish-Pit. So the correct command is "go south".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to reach the cookhouse to get the coin. They've been moving between the Recreation Zone, Dish-Pit, and Attic.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Recreation Zone, Dish-Pit, and Attic. They've been moving back and forth between these areas without making progress towards the cookhouse. The original goal was to reach the cookhouse and retrieve the coin. The user's path has been going east, south, east, north, south, west, east, north, south, etc., which isn't leading them closer to the cookhouse.

Looking at the current position, the user is in the Recreation Zone again. The exits here are north and west. The original plan required moving west after the Dish-Pit, but the user has been circling without finding the cookhouse. Maybe the cookhouse is in a different direction, or the user needs to explore more thoroughly. However, based on the previous steps, the correct next action should be to go west from the Recreation Zone to continue towards the cookhouse. But since the user has been going back and forth, perhaps they need to try a different direction. However, according to the game's current setup, the only unblocked exits are north and west. The user needs to keep moving west to reach the cookhouse. So the next command should be "go west".
