Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, go west. After that, try to head north. And then, go west. If you can do that, go to the south. Then, try to travel west. And then, venture west. Then, attempt to take a trip north. With that done, go east. And then, go to the east. Then, go to the east. Then, pick up the coin from the floor of the canteen. That's it!
