Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to make an attempt to head east. Following that, make an attempt to venture south. Then, make an effort to take a trip south. And then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

-= Pantry =-
You are in a pantry. A standard kind of place.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Bar =-
You are in a bar. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go south

-= Salon =-
You are in a salon. A normal kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go south
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A typical one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an unguarded exit to the north.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchen =-0/4
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text adventure game. They've been moving through different rooms: pantry, bar, salon, and now the kitchen. The goal mentioned earlier was to pick up the coin from the kitchen floor.

So far, the user has gone east from the pantry, then south to the bar, then south again to the salon, and finally south once more to the kitchen. In the kitchen, they found the coin on the floor. The next step would be to pick up the coin. The user's last action was moving south to the kitchen, and now they need to pick up the coin. The game's current state shows the coin is on the floor, so the correct action here is to take the coin. The user needs to input the command "take coin" to pick it up. Since the previous steps were moving around, the next logical step is to pick up the coin to complete the task. The user is close to reaching the goal, so the next action should be to take the coin.
