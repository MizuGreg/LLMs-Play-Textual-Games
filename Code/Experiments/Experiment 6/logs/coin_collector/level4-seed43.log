I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be fantastic if you could make an attempt to travel north. If you can get through with that, go to the east. Then, go north. Following that, recover the coin from the floor of the lounge. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Playroom =-
You find yourself in a playroom. A standard kind of place. The room is well lit.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.
