Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to head west. With that done, move south. And then, head east. And then, move east. Next, make an attempt to venture east. Then, make an attempt to go to the east. Next, make an attempt to go north. And then, lift the coin from the floor of the cookhouse. That's it!
