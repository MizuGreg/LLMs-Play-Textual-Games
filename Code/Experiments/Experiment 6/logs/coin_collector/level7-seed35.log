Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be great if you could make an effort to venture south. With that done, go to the south. Once you do that, make an attempt to move west. And then, travel south. And then, try to head south. Once you succeed at that, try to travel east. Then, lift the coin from the floor of the cookery. Once that's all handled, you can stop!
