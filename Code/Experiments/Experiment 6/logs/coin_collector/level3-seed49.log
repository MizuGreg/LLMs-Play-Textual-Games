Welcome to TextWorld! First stop, try to take a trip east. If you can get around to doing that, try to move east. And then, pick up the coin from the floor of the spare room. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Laundromat =-
You've just sauntered into a laundromat. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Studio =-
You are in a studio. An ordinary one. You can barely contain your excitement.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Spare Room =-
You're now in a spare room. You begin to take stock of what's here.



There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a coin on the floor.
