Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game, and they've been moving through different rooms: studio, kitchen, sauna. The goal is to pick up a coin in the office and then win. 

First, they started in the studio, went south to the kitchen, then east to the sauna. Now they're in the sauna, and the prompt says to try going north or west. The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal.

Hmm, the original instructions said after moving south, east, then north, pick up the coin. So far, they've done south (studio to kitchen), east (kitchen to sauna). The next step was supposed to be north from the kitchen, but they went east instead. Wait, maybe there's a confusion here. Let me check the original directions again.

Original instructions: "attempt to move south. With that done, attempt to go east. And then, take a trip north." So the sequence is south, then east, then north. But in the game, after studio (south to kitchen), then east to sauna. Then from sauna, the correct next step would be north to return to the kitchen? But the user is in the sauna, and the prompt says to try north or west. Maybe the path isn't straightforward. 

Alternatively, maybe the office is in a different direction. The user needs to pick up the coin in the office. So perhaps after the sauna, going north would take them back to the kitchen, then maybe west to reach the office? Or maybe the office is in another direction. 

But the user is in the sauna, and the exit options are north or west. The original plan was to go north from the kitchen, but they went east to the sauna. Now, from the sauna, going north would take them back to the kitchen. Then from the kitchen, maybe they can go west to reach the office? Or perhaps the office is in the north from the sauna? 

Wait, the initial instructions said after moving south, east, then north. So maybe after the sauna, going north would take them back to the kitchen, then from there, they need to go west to reach the office. But the user is in the sauna, and the prompt says to try north or west. So maybe the correct next step is north to get back to the kitchen, then proceed west. But the user is asking if they're close. 

Alternatively, maybe the office is in the sauna, but the coin is in the office. But the user hasn't found it yet. So perhaps the correct path is to go north from the sauna to the kitchen, then west to the office. But the user is in the sauna, so their next action should be north. The user is asking if they're on the right track. 

So the next action should be go north from the sauna to return to the kitchen. Then from the kitchen, go west to reach the office where the coin is. But the user is in the sauna, so the next command is go north.
</think>go north

-= Office =-
You arrive in an office. An ordinary kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a coin on the floor.
