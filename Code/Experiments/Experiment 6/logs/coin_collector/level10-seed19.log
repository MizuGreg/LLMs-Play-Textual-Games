Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, make an attempt to venture west. Then, travel west. If you can accomplish that, head south. With that over with, make an effort to move south. Then, attempt to head west. And then, move south. That done, make an effort to move west. Then, venture south. With that accomplished, attempt to go to the south. With that accomplished, recover the coin from the floor of the study. And once you've done that, you win!

Ah, the laundry place. This is some kind of laundry place, really great usual vibes in this place, a wonderful usual atmosphere. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.
