You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! First, it would be fantastic if you could make an effort to go to the west. If you can get through with that, venture south. Once you accomplish that, make an effort to head west. With that accomplished, move south. Then, go to the south. And then, pick up the coin from the floor of the chamber. And once you've done that, you win!
