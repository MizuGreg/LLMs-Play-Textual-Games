Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an attempt to move north. That done, try to travel east. And then, make an attempt to head north. Then, attempt to venture east. With that done, go south. And then, make an attempt to go to the west. That done, pick up the coin from the floor of the office. Once that's all handled, you can stop!
