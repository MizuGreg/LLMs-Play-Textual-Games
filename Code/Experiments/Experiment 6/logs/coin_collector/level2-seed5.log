Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, go to the north. And then, lift the coin from the floor of the kitchenette. Alright, thanks!

-= Study =-
You find yourself in a study.



There is an unblocked exit to the north.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchenette =-
You've entered a standard room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be standard. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the kitchenette.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchenette, and there's a coin on the floor. The original goal was to lift the coin from the kitchenette's floor. The user already went north from the Study to get here. Now, they need to pick up the coin.

The next step should be to pick up the coin. The command for that would be "lift coin". But wait, in TextWorld, sometimes you have to use specific verbs. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "lift the coin from the floor of the kitchenette". So maybe the correct command is "lift coin" or "take coin". 

Looking at the environment description, the coin is on the floor. So the action is to lift it. The user is in the Kitchenette now, so the command should be straightforward. The previous action was "go north", so the next logical step is to pick up the coin. The user hasn't done that yet, so the next action should be to lift the coin. The answer should be "lift coin".

That's not a verb I recognise.

Okay, the user tried to lift the coin but the system said that's not a recognized verb. Hmm, maybe the correct command is different. Let me check the previous interactions.

In the study, the user was told to go north, which worked. Then in the kitchenette, there's a coin on the floor. The user tried "lift coin", but that didn't work. Maybe the correct verb is "pick up" instead of "lift"? Or perhaps "take"?

Wait, in text adventures, common verbs are "take", "get", "pick up", "lift", "use", etc. The game might expect "take" or "get". Let me think. The user was told to "lift the coin from the floor of the kitchenette", but the system didn't recognize "lift". Maybe the correct command is "take coin" or "get coin".

Alternatively, maybe the game uses "pick up" as the verb. But the user tried "lift", which was invalid. So the next step is to try a different verb. Since the user is in the kitchenette and there's a coin on the floor, the correct action is probably "take coin" or "get coin". Let me check the possible commands again.

The user's previous action was "lift coin", which failed. So the correct command is likely "take coin". Let me try that. The next action should be "take coin".
