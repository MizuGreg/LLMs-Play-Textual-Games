Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an life changing round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to move south. And then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the spare room. Alright, thanks!

-= Studio =-
You've just shown up in a studio. You start to take note of what's in the room.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Spare Room =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the spare room. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Spare Room. They need to retrieve the coin from the floor. The previous action was moving south from the Studio to the Spare Room. Now, the user is told that there's a coin on the floor and an exit to the north.

The task is to get the coin. So the next logical step would be to pick up the coin. But the user has to check if the coin is on the floor. The description says "There is a coin on the floor." So the action should be to take the coin. However, in TextWorld-style games, sometimes you have to use specific commands like 'take coin' or 'get coin'. But the user's previous action was 'go south', which is a direction. So maybe the correct command here is 'take coin' or 'get coin'. But the user's previous interaction used 'go south' as the command. So maybe the correct next step is to pick up the coin. The user needs to retrieve the coin, so the next action should be to take it. Therefore, the answer is 'take coin'.
