Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be great if you could attempt to move south. With that done, attempt to go east. And then, take a trip north. Once you do that, make an effort to travel west. With that accomplished, pick up the coin from the floor of the office. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cookhouse =-
You are in a cookhouse. An ordinary one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Studio =-
You've entered a studio. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and perform specific actions. The goal is to pick up a coin from the floor of the office. So far, they've moved south from the cookhouse to the kitchen, then east to the sauna, and north to the studio. Now they're in the studio, and the room description mentions an unblocked south exit and an unguarded west exit.

The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. Let me think about the path. The original instructions were to go south, east, north, west, then pick up the coin. So far, they've done south, east, north. The next step in the original plan was west. But in the studio, the available exits are south and west. The user has already gone north from the sauna to the studio. So going west from the studio would be the next step as per the original plan. But the user is wondering if they're on the right track.

Wait, the studio is described as oddly familiar, maybe a clue that it's the office? The original goal is to pick up the coin from the office floor. So maybe the studio is the office? If that's the case, then perhaps the coin is here. But the user hasn't picked it up yet. Alternatively, maybe the studio is a different room, and they need to continue moving.

But according to the original instructions, after going north to the studio, the next step was to travel west. So the user should go west from the studio. The studio's description says the west exit is unguarded, so that's doable. If they go west from the studio, they might reach the office where the coin is. Alternatively, maybe the studio is the office, and the coin is here. But the user hasn't picked it up yet. So the next action should be to go west, then check if the coin is there. Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the studio, and they need to pick it up after moving.

But the user's current position is the studio. The next step in the original plan was to go west. So the correct next action is to go west. The user is asking if they're close, so the answer is yes, they're following the correct path. The next step is west. So the assistant should respond with "go west".

-= Office =-
