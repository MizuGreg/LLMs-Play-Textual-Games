Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to venture east. Then, make an attempt to travel east. With that over with, make an attempt to venture north. Then, pick up the coin from the floor of the chamber. Alright, thanks!

-= Office =-
Well, here we are in an office.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Cellar =-
Okay, so you're in a cellar, cool, but is it ordinary? You better believe it is.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Workshop =-
Of every workshop you could have sauntered into, you had to saunter into an ordinary one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in a TextWorld game, moving through different rooms. So far, they've gone east from the Office into the Cellar, then east again into the Workshop. Now, the current room is the Workshop. The prompt says to try going north because that entranceway is unguarded. The user is asked if they think they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. 

First, I need to check the directions available in the Workshop. The description mentions that the user can go north or west. The previous moves were east, so maybe the goal is to find the coin and exit. The user has to pick up the coin from the chamber, so maybe the Workshop has that coin or leads to a room with it.

But the user hasn't picked up the coin yet. The next step is to go north as per the hint. The user might be on the right track since they're moving through different rooms. The count is 0/3, so maybe there are three steps required. Going north in the Workshop could lead to the next room, perhaps the one with the coin. Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the current room, but the user hasn't noticed it yet. However, the instruction says to pick up the coin from the floor of the chamber, so maybe the current room is a chamber. But the Workshop is described as ordinary. 

Wait, the user's previous actions were east, east, and now in the Workshop. The next step is to go north. The user should follow the hint given in the room description: "try going north, that entranceway is unguarded." So the correct action is to go north. The user needs to proceed step by step, following the directions given. The answer should be "go north" again.
</think>go north

-= Chamber =-
You arrive in a chamber. An usual kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is a coin on the floor.
