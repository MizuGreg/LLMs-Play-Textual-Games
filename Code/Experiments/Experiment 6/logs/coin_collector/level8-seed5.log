It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to go to the north. And then, go to the east. With that over with, try to head south. After that, make an effort to head east. And then, make an attempt to go north. Then, take a trip west. Then, try to venture south. Then, lift the coin from the floor of the playroom. And once you've done that, you win!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has followed a series of directions to move through different rooms. The goal is to lift the coin from the playroom and win. So far, they've gone from the garage to the kitchenette, then to the study, and now they're in the chamber. The current room is the Chamber, which has exits to the east and north. The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal.

First, I need to figure out the correct path based on the game's structure. The initial instructions said to go north, then east, south, east, north, west, south, then lift the coin. Let me check the rooms they've been through:

1. Garage (start) → North → Kitchenette.
2. Kitchenette → East → Study.
3. Study → South → Chamber.

Now, the Chamber has exits to East and North. The next steps in the original plan were to go east, then north, then west, then south. But the user is asking if they're on the right track. Let's see: from the Chamber, going east would be the next step as per the original plan. But maybe there's a different path. Alternatively, maybe the playroom is in a different direction.

Wait, the original task mentioned lifting the coin from the playroom. So the playroom must be a room that's reachable through these exits. Let me think about the possible layout. The user is in the Chamber now. The exits are east and north. Let's consider that the playroom might be in one of those directions. But the user's next steps in the original plan were to go east, then north, then west, then south. So from Chamber, going east would be step 5 (original plan's fifth step: after going south from study, then east). Then from there, go north, then west, then south. But I need to check if that's the correct path.

Alternatively, maybe the playroom is in the north direction from the Chamber. But the user hasn't reached it yet. The user is asking if they're close. So, based on the current position in the Chamber, the next step according to the original plan is to go east. So the answer should be "go east" again. But I need to make sure that's the correct next move. The user's plan is to go east from the Chamber, then north, then west, then south. So the next action is go east.

-= Cookhouse =-
You are in a cookhouse. An ordinary one.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Bedroom now. The previous steps were: Garage → Kitchenette → Study → Chamber → Cookhouse → Bedroom. The original plan was to go north, east, south, east, north, west, south, then lift the coin.

In the Bedroom, the exits are south and west. The user's next steps according to the original plan would be to go west (since after reaching the Bedroom, the next step was to go west). But the user is asking if they're close to the goal. So, from the Bedroom, going west would be the next move. Let me check the original instructions again. The user's plan after the Chamber was to go east, then north, then west, then south. Wait, but in the current path, they went from Chamber to Cookhouse (east), then to Bedroom (north). Now, from Bedroom, the next step in the original plan was to go west. So the correct next action is west. But the user is asking if they're close. So the answer is to go west.

-= Bedchamber =-
You've just shown up in a bedchamber.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

That's not a verb I recognise.

Okay, the user is in the Playroom and there's a coin on the floor. They tried to "lift coin" but the game said that's not a recognized verb. So I need to figure out the correct command to pick up the coin.

In text adventures, usually, you "take" an item instead of "lift". So maybe the correct command is "take coin". Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "lift the coin from the floor of the playroom", but the game might expect "take" instead. So the next action should be "take coin".
