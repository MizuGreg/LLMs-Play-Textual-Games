Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could move south. Once you get around to doing that, head west. And then, make an attempt to take a trip north. And then, head west. And then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the studio. Alright, thanks!

-= Closet =-
You arrive in a closet. An usual one.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go south
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Attic =-
Well, here we are in an attic. You begin to take stock of what's here.



There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Attic =-0/2
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Cellar =-
You've seen better cellars, but at least this one seems pretty standard. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Cellar =-0/3
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go north
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Canteen =-
You arrive in a canteen. An usual kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an unblocked exit to the south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Canteen =-0/4
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Studio =-
You have stumbled into a studio. Not the studio you'd expect. No, this is a studio. You begin to take stock of what's here.



There is an unguarded exit to the east.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Studio =-0/5
