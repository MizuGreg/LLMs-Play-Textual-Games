Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could go to the west. Then, make an attempt to move west. Next, pick-up the coin from the floor of the closet. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Vault =-
You are in a vault. A standard one. You can barely contain your excitement.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

go west

-= Cookhouse =-
You find yourself in a cookhouse. An ordinary one.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

-= Closet =-
You find yourself in a closet. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.
