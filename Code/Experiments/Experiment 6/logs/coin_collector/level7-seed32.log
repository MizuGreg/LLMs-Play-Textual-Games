Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an attempt to take a trip south. With that accomplished, venture west. Next, make an attempt to venture west. Following that, venture south. Then, move west. Next, try to travel south. Following that, recover the coin from the floor of the salon. Once that's all handled, you can stop!
