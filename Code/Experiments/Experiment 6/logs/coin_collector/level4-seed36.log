Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, attempt to move east. That done, head south. Once you manage that, make an attempt to travel east. And then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the workshop. Alright, thanks!

-= Sauna =-
Well how about that, you are in the place we're calling the sauna. The room is well lit.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Kitchen =-
You're now in the kitchen.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

-= Spare Room =-
Look at you, bigshot, walking into a spare room like it isn't some huge deal.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

Well, here we are in the workshop. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

There is a coin on the floor.
