Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, try to venture north. After that, recover the coin from the floor of the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedchamber =-
You've entered a bedchamber. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen, and there's a coin on the floor. The task is to recover the coin from the kitchen floor and then win. So the next step is to pick up the coin. But wait, the user just entered the kitchen, and the previous action was going north from the bedchamber. Now, in the kitchen, the prompt says there's a coin on the floor. So the correct action here is to pick up the coin. The user needs to collect it. The next command should be "take coin" or "pick up coin". But in TextWorld, the exact command might be "take coin" since that's the standard verb. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "recover the coin from the floor of the kitchen". So the correct action is to take the coin. The user is in the kitchen, so the command would be "take coin". That's the next step after entering the kitchen.
