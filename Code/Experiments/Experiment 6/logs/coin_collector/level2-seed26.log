You are now playing a profound round of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, move south. Once you get around to doing that, recover the coin from the floor of the cellar. And once you"ve done that, you win!

-= Attic =-
You've just shown up in an attic.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.
