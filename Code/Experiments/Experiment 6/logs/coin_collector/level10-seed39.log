It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, head north. And then, make an attempt to go east. With that done, go east. Next, move south. Then, attempt to travel west. Then, try to take a trip west. With that done, go north. After that, head north. Then, head east. Following that, pick-up the coin from the floor of the laundry place.
