It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to try to move north. Once you finish that, make an effort to venture east. And then, make an effort to head east. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the salon. Got that? Good!

-= Kitchenette =-
You've come into a normal room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be normal. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the kitchenette. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.
