Welcome to TextWorld! First, it would be a great idea if you could make an attempt to take a trip south. With that accomplished, venture west. Next, pick up the coin from the floor of the chamber. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just sauntered into a bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

>                                                                                                                                -= Bedroom =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go south

-= Workshop =-
You are in a workshop. A standard one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west

-= Chamber =-
You are in a chamber. An usual kind of place.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
