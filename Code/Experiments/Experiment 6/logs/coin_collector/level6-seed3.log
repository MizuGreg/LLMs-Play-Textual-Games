Welcome to TextWorld! First off, venture north. And then, take a trip east. Then, move east. After that, make an effort to take a trip south. Okay, and then, take a trip west. And then, pick up the coin from the floor of the laundromat. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bar =-
You've entered a bar.



There is an unguarded exit to the north.

-= Basement =-
Ah, the basement. This is some kind of basement, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld. The initial instructions told them to go north, then east, east again, south, west, and finally pick up a coin in the laundromat. So far, they've gone north from the bar into the basement. The current room is the basement, which has unguarded exits to east and south.

The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. The previous steps align with the instructions: after going north, the next steps should be east, then east again, then south, west, and finally pick up the coin. 

In the basement, the available directions are east and south. The user's next action should be to go east as per the initial plan. The user might be confused if they're not sure if east is the correct direction, but the prompt says to follow the sequence: after north, east, east, south, west, then coin. So the next step is definitely east again. The user needs to go east twice, then south, west, and then collect the coin. Since they're in the basement, going east once would be the next step. The user should proceed with "go east" again.

-= Bedroom =-
A well framed signboard tells you that you are now in the bedroom. Let's see what's in here.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been following the initial instructions: go north, then east, then east again, then south, then west, and finally pick up the coin from the laundromat. So far, they've moved from the Bar to the Basement, then to the Bedroom.

The current location is the Bedroom. The exits here are east and west. The original plan was after moving west, they would pick up the coin in the laundromat. But the user hasn't picked up the coin yet. Let me check the path again.

Wait, the initial steps were: go north (to Basement), then east (to Bedroom), then east again. Wait, but the Bedroom only has east and west exits. So going east from Bedroom would take them to another room, maybe the laundromat? Or maybe the next step after Bedroom is to go west back to Basement, then south to Bar? But the original plan was to go west after the Bedroom steps.

Wait, the user's original plan was after the initial moves (north, east, east, south, west), then pick up the coin. So after the Bedroom, they need to go west to return to the Basement, then south to the Bar? But the coin is in the laundromat. Maybe the laundromat is a different room. Wait, the original instruction said "pick up the coin from the floor of the laundromat." So the laundromat must be a room that's been visited.

But in the current path, the user is in the Bedroom. The next step would be to go west to the Basement, then south to the Bar? But that's not the laundromat. Maybe the laundromat is another room. Alternatively, maybe after the Bedroom, they need to go east again to reach the laundromat. But the Bedroom's east exit is unblocked. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the laundromat is the Bar? But the Bar is the starting point. Hmm. The user's original plan was to go north (Bar -> Basement), then east (Basement -> Bedroom), then east again (Bedroom -> ?), then south, then west, then pick up the coin. But the current location is Bedroom. If they go east from Bedroom, they might reach the laundromat. But the user hasn't picked up the coin yet. So maybe the next step is to go east from Bedroom to reach the laundromat, then pick up the coin. But the user's next action would be to go east again. But the user's original plan was to go east, east, south, west. So after Bedroom, they should go west to Basement, then south to Bar? But that's not the laundromat. Maybe the laundromat is a different room. Alternatively, perhaps the laundromat is the Bedroom? But that seems unlikely.

Wait, the original instruction said "pick up the coin from the floor of the laundromat." So the laundromat is a specific room. The user hasn't visited it yet. So maybe after the Bedroom, they need to go east to reach the laundromat. But the Bedroom's east exit is unblocked. So maybe that's the way. So the next step is to go east from Bedroom to reach the laundromat, then pick up the coin. But the user's current step is in the Bedroom. The next action would be to go east. But the user's original plan was to go east, east, south, west. So after Bedroom, they would go east again, then south, then west. But that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe the laundromat is in the Basement. But the Basement is a different room.

Alternatively, maybe the laundromat is the Bar. But the Bar is the starting point. The user hasn't picked up the coin yet. So perhaps the correct path is to go from Bedroom west to Basement, then south to Bar, but that's not the laundromat. This is confusing. Maybe the laundromat is the Bedroom? But the user hasn't picked up the coin there. The original instruction says to pick up the coin from the laundromat. So the laundromat must be a separate room. Therefore, the user needs to find the laundromat. Since the user is in the Bedroom, maybe going east from there leads to the laundromat. So the next action is to go east.

-= Kitchenette =-
You've entered a kitchenette. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchenette =-0/4

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game: starting in the bar, then the basement, bedroom, and now the kitchenette. The original instructions were to go north, then east, east, south, west, and finally pick up the coin from the laundromat.

Wait, the current room is the kitchenette. The user's next steps should be to go south, as per the initial plan. The kitchenette has an exit to the south and west. The user was supposed to move south after the two easts. So the next action should be "go south". Let me check the previous steps again to confirm. Yes, the sequence was north, east, east, then south. So from the kitchenette, going south would be the next step. Then after that, they needed to go west. But first, the south step. So the correct command here is "go south".
</think>go south

-= Shower =-
You're now in the shower.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the building: starting from the bar, then the basement, bedroom, kitchenette, and now the shower. The original instructions were to go north, then east twice, then south, then west, and finally pick up the coin in the laundromat.

Wait, the current room is the shower. The next step after the shower would be to go west, as per the previous steps. The user has already gone north (from bar to basement), then east (basement to bedroom), east again (bedroom to kitchenette), south (kitchenette to shower). Now, the next step should be west from the shower. The prompt says to try going west since it's unguarded. So the correct action here is to go west. Let me check the previous steps again to make sure. Yes, the sequence was north, east, east, south, now west. Then after that, the coin in the laundromat. So the next command should be go west.

-= Laundromat =-
Well, here we are in a laundromat.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and complete certain tasks. The original instructions mentioned venturing north, then east, east again, south, west, and finally picking up a coin from the laundromat.

Looking at the current room, it's the Laundromat, and there's a coin on the floor. The user's last action was going west, which led them here. The next step according to the original plan was to pick up the coin. The prompt here says, "pick up the coin from the floor of the laundromat." So the next action should be to take the coin. The user has to make sure they do that before stopping. Since the coin is explicitly mentioned here, the correct command is to pick it up. I need to check if there are any other steps, but according to the original instructions, after reaching the laundromat, the next step is to pick up the coin. So the answer should be "take coin" or "pick up coin." The game's commands might require using "take" instead of "pick up," but the exact wording might vary. However, the user's previous actions have been "go" commands, so maybe "take coin" is the right syntax here.
