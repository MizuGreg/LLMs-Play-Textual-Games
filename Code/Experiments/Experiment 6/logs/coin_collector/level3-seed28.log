Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to travel east. With that over with, head north. Then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the workshop. That's it!

-= Laundromat =-
You find yourself in a laundromat. A normal kind of place.



There is an unblocked exit to the east.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Bedroom =-
You have moved into a bedroom. Not the bedroom you'd expect. No, this is a bedroom. Let's see what's in here.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Workshop =-
Here we are in the workshop.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.
