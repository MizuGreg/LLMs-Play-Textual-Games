I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First step, make an attempt to move north. That done, try to travel east. And then, make an attempt to head north. Then, recover the coin from the floor of the canteen. That's it!

-= Sauna =-
I just think it's great that you've just entered a sauna. Let's see what's in here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Cubicle =-
Well, here we are in a cubicle.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the south.
