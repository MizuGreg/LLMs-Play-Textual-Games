It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be fantastic if you could make an effort to move north. And then, make an attempt to move west. After that, retrieve the coin from the floor of the attic. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Kitchenette =-
You've entered a kitchenette. You can barely contain your excitement.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

>                                                                                                                                -= Kitchenette =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go north
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Canteen =-
You find yourself in a canteen. A standard one.



There is an unblocked exit to the south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Canteen =-0/2
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Attic =-
You are in an attic. A standard kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Attic =-0/3
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
pick up coin
