Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be fantastic if you could try to venture east. Then, venture south. After that, try to go to the south. Once you succeed at that, try to go west. If you can finish that, try to move north. That done, make an effort to take a trip east. After that, try to take a trip south. Okay, and then, try to travel south. Then, travel south. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the bedroom. And if you do that, you're the winner!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game called TextWorld. Their goal is to navigate through different rooms and eventually recover a coin from the bedroom. The current situation is that they've been moving between the Spare Room and the Attic, going east and west repeatedly. The user is now asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal.

First, I need to figure out the correct path based on the game's environment. The initial instructions said to go east, then south, then west, north, east, south, and so on. But the user is stuck in a loop between the Spare Room and the Attic. Each time they go east from the Spare Room, they end up in the Attic, and going west from the Attic brings them back. So maybe the key is to find a different path once they're in the Attic. The Attic has an unguarded exit to the south, which might lead to another room. But the user hasn't tried going south from the Attic yet. 

Looking at the previous steps: the user went east to the Attic, then west back to the Spare Room, then east again to the Attic, and so on. The next logical step would be to try going south from the Attic. The user hasn't done that yet. The original goal mentions traveling south multiple times, so maybe after getting to the Attic, going south is the next step. Once they go south from the Attic, they might reach a new room, perhaps the bedroom where the coin is located. But the user hasn't tried that yet. 

The user's current position is in the Attic, and the next action should be to go south. That's the unguarded exit mentioned. So the correct command here is "go south". The user might be missing this step because they're focused on moving east and west, but the Attic's south exit is the key to progressing further. Once they go south, they might enter a room that's part of the path to the bedroom. Therefore, the next action should be to go south from the Attic.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Spare Room and the Attic, going east and west repeatedly. The original goal was to venture east, then south, west, north, east, south, and finally recover the coin in the bedroom. The user has been moving east and west, but hasn't tried going south from the Attic yet. The Steam Room was reached by going south from the Attic, but then they went north back to the Attic. Now, they're back at the Attic again. The next logical step should be to go south from the Attic again, as that's the unguarded exit mentioned. Maybe that leads to a different room, perhaps the bedroom. The user needs to keep trying to go south once they're in the Attic. So the next action should be "go south".

Okay, the user is moving between the Steam Room and the Attic, going north and south repeatedly. The original goal was to eventually get to the bedroom and recover the coin. So far, they've been stuck in a loop. The key might be to find a different path once they're in the Steam Room. The Steam Room has an unguarded exit to the south, which leads back to the Attic. But maybe there's another way. Wait, the user needs to go east, south, west, north, etc., as per the initial instructions. Maybe after several moves, they need to find a door that leads to the bedroom. Alternatively, perhaps the coin is in the Steam Room or another room they've passed. But the user hasn't tried exploring other directions yet. The next step should be to check if there's a door east or west in the Steam Room. The current prompt says to try going north, but maybe they should try a different direction. However, the user's last action was going south, which brought them back to the Steam Room. The next possible action is to go east or west in the Steam Room. But the Steam Room's description mentions an unguarded exit to the south and north. Wait, the user is in the Steam Room, and the prompt says "You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south." So maybe the user should try going east or west here. But the previous actions were north and south. Maybe the user needs to explore other directions. However, the game's environment might not have doors in those directions. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to keep going south from the Attic to reach the bedroom. But the user is stuck in a loop. The correct path might require moving east from the Steam Room, but the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next action should be to go east in the Steam Room.

Okay, the user is in the Steam Room and tried going east and west, but those directions are blocked. The Steam Room has an unguarded exit to the south and north. The user previously went north to the Attic and south to the Attic again. Since east and west are blocked here, the next possible move is to go south again. But wait, going south from the Steam Room would lead back to the Attic. The user has been looping between the Steam Room and Attic. The original goal was to reach the bedroom and get the coin. Maybe the user needs to find another path. But according to the game's current state, the only unblocked directions are north and south. Since the user is stuck, maybe they need to keep going south from the Steam Room to eventually reach a room that leads to the bedroom. Alternatively, maybe the coin is in the Steam Room, but the user hasn't checked. However, the user's task was to recover the coin from the bedroom. So perhaps the user needs to find a way to get to the bedroom through other rooms. But based on the current information, the next possible action is to go south again.

Okay, the user is in the Bedchamber. The previous action was "look", but the game didn't recognize it. The correct command should be a verb like "go" or "take". The user's goal is to recover the coin from the bedroom. The Bedchamber has exits to the north and west. The user needs to find the coin. Maybe the coin is in the Bedchamber, so they should check the room. The correct command here is "look" but since it's not working, perhaps "examine" or "check". But the game might only accept "look". Alternatively, the user might need to go west or north. The original goal mentioned traveling south multiple times, but now they're in the Bedchamber. The coin is in the bedroom, so maybe the user needs to look around. The correct action is "look" again, even though it was rejected. Alternatively, "take coin" if it's present. But the user hasn't found the coin yet. So the next step is to look again.

Okay, the user is in the Basement again, stuck in a loop between the Cubicle and Basement. The original goal was to recover the coin from the bedroom. So far, they've been moving around but haven't found the coin. The current room is the Basement, which has exits to the south and west. The user needs to find the coin, which is in the bedroom. Maybe they need to go west from the Basement. The previous attempts to go north and south didn't help. The correct path might be to go west from the Basement to reach the bedroom. So the next action should be "go west".

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Cubicle and Basement, moving north and south repeatedly. The original goal was to recover the coin from the bedroom. So far, they've been moving through different rooms but haven't found the coin. The current room is the Cubicle, which has exits to the north and south. The user needs to find the coin, which is in the bedroom. Maybe they need to go north from the Cubicle to reach the bedroom. The previous attempts to go south and west didn't help. The correct path might be to go north from the Cubicle.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the Basement and Kitchenette, moving east and west repeatedly. The original goal was to recover the coin from the bedroom. So far, they've been moving through different rooms but haven't found the coin. The current room is the Basement, which has exits to the south and west. The user needs to find the coin, which is in the bedroom. Maybe they need to go west from the Basement to reach the bedroom. The previous attempts to go north and south didn't help. The correct path might be to go west from the Basement.
</think>go west

-= Kitchenette =-
You arrive in a kitchenette. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.
