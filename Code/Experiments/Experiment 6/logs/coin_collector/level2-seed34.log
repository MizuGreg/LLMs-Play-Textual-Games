Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, make an effort to go to the east. Then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the pantry. That"s it!

-= Cookhouse =-
You are in a cookhouse. An usual one. You begin to take stock of what's here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

>                                                                                                                                -= Cookhouse =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east

-= Pantry =-
You are in a pantry. A standard kind of place. Let's see what's in here.



There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Pantry =-0/2
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
