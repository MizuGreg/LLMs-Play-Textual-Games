Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, head west. And then, try to take a trip west. With that done, attempt to go west. Once you accomplish that, make an effort to go to the south. Following that, try to take a trip east. After that, take a trip east. With that accomplished, lift the coin from the floor of the garage. Got that? Good!
