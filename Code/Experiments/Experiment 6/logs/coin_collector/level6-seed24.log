Welcome to another fast paced episode of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, head west. And then, attempt to travel north. Once you manage that, go north. And then, make an attempt to venture east. After that, take a trip north. Following that, lift the coin from the floor of the bedchamber. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Study =-
Of every study you could have shown up in, you had to walk into an ordinary one.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Laundromat =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so ordinary all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the laundromat. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.
