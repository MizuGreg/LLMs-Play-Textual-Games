Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be fantastic if you could go to the west. Then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the cookhouse. Alright, thanks!

-= Vault =-
You are in a vault. An ordinary one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

>                                                                                                                                -= Vault =-0/1

go west

-= Cookhouse =-
Well, here we are in a cookhouse.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.
