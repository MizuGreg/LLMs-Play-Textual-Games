Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to make an attempt to head east. Following that, make an attempt to venture south. Then, make an effort to take a trip south. And then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

You are in a pantry. A standard kind of place.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
