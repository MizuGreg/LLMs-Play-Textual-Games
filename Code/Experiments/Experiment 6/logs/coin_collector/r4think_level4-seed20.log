Welcome to another exciting session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to head north. With that accomplished, go to the north. Then, make an effort to go north. Then, pick up the coin from the floor of the study. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Garage =-
You are in a garage. An usual one.



There is an unguarded exit to the north.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Study =-
Well I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a study.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

There is a coin on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Study room. The goal is to pick up the coin on the floor and then win. The previous steps were moving north from the Garage, then Sauna, then Salon, and now Study. The instruction says to go south from the Study. But wait, the user is told "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south." So maybe going south from here would lead back to the Salon? But the coin is in the Study. So the next step is to pick up the coin. But the user hasn't done that yet. Wait, the current room is Study, and there's a coin on the floor. So the next action should be to pick up the coin. But the user's last action was going north, which led to Study. Now, the prompt says "Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far?" and the user needs to decide the next action. The user has to pick up the coin. So the correct command is "take coin" or "pick up coin". But in TextWorld, the command might be "take coin" or "get coin". Let me check the previous interactions. In the Study room, the user is told there's a coin on the floor. So the next step is to pick it up. The user's previous actions were moving north three times. Now, in Study, the correct action is to take the coin. Then, after that, the game would win. So the next command should be "take coin".
