Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, try to move north. Once you finish that, recover the coin from the floor of the spare room. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Basement =-
You've just sauntered into a basement.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

>                                                                                                                                -= Basement =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go north

-= Spare Room =-
You arrive in an usual kind of place. That is to say, you're in a spare room. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

There is a coin on the floor.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
