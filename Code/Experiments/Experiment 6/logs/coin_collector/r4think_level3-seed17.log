You are now playing a profound episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, make an attempt to head east. Following that, make an attempt to venture south. Then, pick up the coin from the floor of the salon. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Pantry =-
You find yourself in a pantry. A standard one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unblocked.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Bar =-
You're now in a bar.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south. There is an unblocked exit to the west.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go south
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Salon =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just stumbled into a salon.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Salon =-0/3
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in the Salon, which is the third room. The previous steps were going east from the Pantry to the Bar, then south to the Salon. The goal mentioned earlier was to pick up the coin from the salon's floor and then stop. So far, the user hasn't picked up the coin yet.

In the current Salon room, the prompt says there's a coin on the floor. The next logical step would be to pick up the coin. The user's last action was going south, which led them to the Salon. Now, they need to pick up the coin. The command should be "take coin" or "pick up coin". But in TextWorld, the correct command is usually "take" followed by the item name. So the correct action here is "take coin".
</think>take coin
