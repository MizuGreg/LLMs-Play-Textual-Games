I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, attempt to move south. With that done, attempt to go east. And then, take a trip north. Once you do that, make an effort to travel west. With that accomplished, take a trip west. Okay, and then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the cookhouse. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cookery =-

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.
