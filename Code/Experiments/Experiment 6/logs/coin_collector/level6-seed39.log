Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, head north. And then, make an attempt to go east. With that done, go east. Next, move south. Then, attempt to travel west. Then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the cubicle. And if you do that, you're the winner!
