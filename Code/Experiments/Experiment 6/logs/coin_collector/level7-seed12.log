Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, go to the west. Then, make an attempt to move west. Next, venture west. And then, venture north. If you can finish that, attempt to go west. And then, venture south. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the cubicle. That's it!

-= Vault =-
You're now in a vault. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.
