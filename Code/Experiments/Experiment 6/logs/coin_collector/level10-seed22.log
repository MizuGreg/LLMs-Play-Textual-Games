Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to head west. And then, try to take a trip west. With that done, attempt to go west. Once you accomplish that, make an effort to go to the south. Following that, try to take a trip east. After that, take a trip east. With that accomplished, move east. If you can get around to doing that, travel north. Next, make an attempt to head east. Then, lift the coin from the floor of the office. That's it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.
