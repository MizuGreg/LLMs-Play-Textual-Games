Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, go to the east. Following that, attempt to go south. After that, take a trip east. Then, attempt to move east. Okay, and then, make an attempt to go north. Once you manage that, retrieve the coin from the floor of the bedroom. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Study =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the study. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east.

-= Cubicle =-
You're now in a cubicle. You begin to take stock of what's here.



There is an unblocked exit to the south. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going west.

Well, here we are in the office.



There is an unblocked exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in the Office, and the current prompt says there's an unblocked exit to the east. The advice is to try going north since that entranceway is unguarded. But the user's previous actions were going east, then south, then east again. Wait, the original task was to go east, then south, then east, then attempt to move east again, then north. After that, get the coin in the bedroom.

So far, the user has gone east (from Study to Cubicle), then south (to Office), then east again. Now, the next step according to the task is to attempt to move east again. But in the current location (Office), the exit to the east is unblocked. So maybe the next command should be go east again. But the prompt here says the Office has an unblocked exit to the east and suggests going north. Hmm, maybe the user is supposed to follow the original instructions step by step.

Wait, the original instructions said: First, go east. Then attempt to go south. Then take a trip east. Then attempt to move east. Then go north. So after the first east (Study to Cubicle), then south (Cubicle to Office), then east (Office to somewhere?), then attempt to move east again. But in the Office, going east is possible. So maybe the next step is to go east again from the Office. But the current prompt says that in the Office, the exit to the east is unblocked, so going east would be possible. Then after that, the next step is to attempt to go north. So the user's next action should be go east again. But the user's last action was go south, which took them to the Office. So the next step is to go east again. Then, after that, attempt to move east again (maybe that's a failed attempt?), then go north. So the next command is go east.
</think>go east

-= Attic =-
You're not going to believe this, but you've just entered an attic.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Recreation Zone =-
You find yourself in a recreation zone. A standard kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Recreation Zone =-0/5

Okay, let's break down the user's progress so far. The original task was to navigate through the game by moving in specific directions and then retrieve a coin from the bedroom. The user started in the Study, went east to the Cubicle, then south to the Office, east again to the Attic, and now east again to the Recreation Zone.

The current location is the Recreation Zone, where the exits to the north and west are unblocked. The next step according to the original instructions was to attempt to move east after going east three times. But in the Recreation Zone, moving east is possible, but the user's next action should follow the planned sequence. However, the user's last action was going east from the Attic to the Recreation Zone. The next step in the original plan was to attempt to move east again, but in the Recreation Zone, the user might need to go north or west as per the current prompt. However, the original plan after reaching the Recreation Zone would be to go north, as per the task's steps. Wait, the original task said after attempting to move east, then go north. So after the Recreation Zone, the next step should be going north. But the user's current location is the Recreation Zone, and the next step is to go north. So the correct command here is go north.

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. An ordinary one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.
