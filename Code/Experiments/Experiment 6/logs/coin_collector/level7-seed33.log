I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First thing I need you to do is to take a trip west. With that over with, try to head south. With that over with, go to the east. With that done, make an effort to go to the east. That done, make an attempt to go south. Next, venture east. Then, lift the coin from the floor of the bedroom. And if you do that, you're the winner!
