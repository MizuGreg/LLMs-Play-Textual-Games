Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, venture north. And then, travel north. And then, venture east. Following that, attempt to go to the east. That done, go to the south. And then, attempt to go west. Next, venture north. Okay, and then, head north. After that, take a trip west. And then, move west. Then, make an effort to move south. With that done, attempt to take a trip south. Then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the shower. Alright, thanks!
