Welcome to another exciting episode of TextWorld! Your first objective is to head west. And then, attempt to travel north. Once you manage that, pick-up the coin from the floor of the washroom. Alright, thanks!

-= Study =-
You find yourself in a study. A standard one.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Laundromat =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a laundromat, but I guess I was wrong.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

You've just sauntered into a washroom.



There is an unguarded exit to the south.

There is a coin on the floor.
