Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, venture north. And then, take a trip east. Then, move east. After that, make an effort to take a trip south. Okay, and then, take a trip west. And then, make an attempt to take a trip west. And then, make an effort to head south. With that done, make an attempt to go to the south. If you can succeed at that, pick-up the coin from the floor of the sauna. And once you've done that, you win!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has been moving through different rooms. The goal mentioned earlier was to pick up a coin in the sauna and then win. So far, they've gone through the canteen, basement, bedroom, kitchenette, shower, and laundromat. Now they're in the laundromat.

The current room is the laundromat. The exits mentioned are east and west. The user's previous action was going west, which led them here. The提示 says there's an exit to the east, which is unblocked, and to try going west if they need an unguarded exit. But since they're already in the laundromat, maybe the next step is to check if there's a path towards the sauna. 

Wait, the original plan was to go north, then east, east, south, west, west, south, then south again to get to the sauna. But the user has been moving east and west, but maybe they're not on the correct path. Let me think about the rooms they've passed through. 

From the canteen (north), basement (east), bedroom (east), kitchenette (south), shower (west), laundromat (west). Now, from the laundromat, the exit is east (unblocked) and west. If they go east from the laundromat, maybe they can reach another area. But the original plan was to go south again after the laundromat. Wait, the original instructions said after the laundromat, they should try going south. But the laundromat's description says to try going west if they need an unguarded exit. However, the user's next step might be to go east from the laundromat, as that's the unblocked exit. But the original goal is to get to the sauna, which is probably in a different part of the map. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from the laundromat. But the laundromat's description says to try going west if they need an unguarded exit. However, the user's previous steps might have missed the correct path. Let me check the original instructions again. The user was told to go north, then east, east, south, west, west, south, then south again. So after the laundromat (which is after going west from the shower), the next step was to go south. But the laundromat's description says to try going west. Wait, maybe there's a confusion here. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east from the laundromat. Let me think. The laundromat has an exit to the east. If they go east, maybe they reach another room. But the original plan was to go south after the laundromat. However, the laundromat's description says to try going west if they need an unguarded exit. But the user's next action should be to go east, as that's the unblocked exit. But the original goal is to reach the sauna. Maybe the sauna is in a different part of the map. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user is on the correct path. After the laundromat, going east might lead them to the next room. But the original plan was to go south. However, the laundromat's description says to try going west. Wait, maybe the user is supposed to go west again from the laundromat. But the user's previous action was going west to get here. So maybe the next step is to go east. 

But the user is asking if they're making the right actions. The user has followed the initial directions: north, east, east, south, west, west, south, then south again. But in the current room (laundromat), the next step is to go east or west. The original plan was to go south after the laundromat. However, the laundromat's description says to try going west if they need an unguarded exit. But the user's next move should be to go east, as that's the unblocked exit. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go south from the laundromat. But the laundromat's description doesn't mention a south exit. The user might need to check the exits again. The laundromat's description says there's an exit to the east and to try going west. So the user should go east. 

So the next action would be to go east from the laundromat. That's the unblocked exit. Then, perhaps they can proceed towards the sauna. The user is close, but needs to continue moving towards the correct direction. The original plan was to go south after the laundromat, but maybe that's not the case. So the correct next step is to go east.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is stuck in a loop between the Laundromat and the Shower. Every time they try to go east from the Laundromat, they end up back in the Shower, and vice versa. The original goal was to get to the sauna to pick up the coin and win. But so far, the user has been moving through different rooms without reaching the sauna.

Looking at the previous steps, the user followed the initial directions: north, east, east, south, west, west, south, then south again. But it seems like the path is leading them in a cycle between the Laundromat and the Shower. Maybe the correct path isn't following the exact steps given, or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the directions.

The user needs to reach the sauna, which is probably in a different part of the map. Since the current rooms are Laundromat and Shower, maybe they need to find another exit. The Laundromat has an exit to the east, which is unblocked. But going east leads back to the Shower. The Shower has an exit to the north and west. Going north from the Shower might lead to another room, but the user hasn't tried that yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Laundromat again, but that's where they came from. It's possible that the correct path requires moving in a different direction, like south from the Laundromat, but the description doesn't mention a south exit. The user might need to explore other exits or find a way to break the loop.

Since the user is stuck in a loop, the next step should be to try going north from the Shower, as that's mentioned as an unblocked exit. That might lead them to a new room that's part of the path to the sauna. So the next action should be to go north from the Shower.
