Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Your task for today is to pick up the coin from the floor of the attic.

-= Attic =-
You arrive in an attic. A standard one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.





There is a coin on the floor.
