Once you finish that, make an attempt to go to the east. Okay, and then, travel east. Then, go south. Then, make an attempt to go to the east. With that accomplished, go to the east. Once you succeed at that, go to the north. Then, attempt to head west. After that, move north. Then, attempt to travel west. With that over with, make an attempt to venture north. That done, lift the coin from the floor of the studio. Once that's all handled, you can stop!
