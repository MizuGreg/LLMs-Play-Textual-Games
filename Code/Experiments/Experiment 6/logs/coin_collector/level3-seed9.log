It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, head south. With that accomplished, make an attempt to travel south. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the sauna. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Basement =-
You find yourself in a basement. A normal one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

>                                                                                                                                -= Basement =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go south
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Bedchamber =-
You have moved into the most normal of all possible bedchambers.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go south
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Sauna =-
You arrive in a sauna. A standard kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Sauna =-0/3
