It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, head south. With that accomplished, make an attempt to travel south. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the sauna. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Basement =-
You find yourself in a basement. A normal one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Bedchamber =-
You have moved into the most normal of all possible bedchambers.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game called TextWorld. The goal is to explore the basement, go south, then recover a coin from the sauna, and win. So far, they've moved from the basement to the bedchamber. The current room is the bedchamber, and the user is asked if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal.

First, I need to recall the previous steps. The user started in the basement, went south into the bedchamber. The next step would be to check if there's a path south from the bedchamber. The description says that south is unblocked, so maybe going south again is the next move. But the user is in the bedchamber now. The original plan was to go south from the basement, then maybe proceed further. But the user is now in the bedchamber, and the next step might be to go south again. However, the user is asking if they're on the right track. 

The user's question is whether they're making the right actions. The original goal was to go south from the basement, then recover the coin in the sauna. So, moving south from the basement to the bedchamber is the first step. Now, from the bedchamber, the next logical step would be to go south again, as the bedchamber's south is unblocked. But the user is in the bedchamber, and the next move would be to go south. However, the user is asking if they're close to the goal. 

Wait, the original task said: "First of all, you could, like, head south. With that accomplished, make an attempt to travel south. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the sauna. And once you've done that, you win!" So the first step is to go south from the basement. Then, after that, travel south again (from the bedchamber?), then go to the sauna to get the coin. 

So the user has already gone south once (from basement to bedchamber). The next step is to go south again from the bedchamber. Then, perhaps the sauna is next. But the user is in the bedchamber now, and the next action would be to go south. So the next command should be "go south" again. 

But the user is asking if they're making the right actions. The user is in the bedchamber, and the next step is to go south. So the correct next action is "go south". The user is on the right track. The answer should be "go south".

-= Sauna =-
You arrive in a sauna. A standard kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to navigate through different rooms and recover a coin in a sauna to win. So far, they've gone from the basement to the bedchamber and then to the sauna. The current room is the sauna, and there's a coin on the floor.

The original goal was to head south from the basement, then travel south again to reach the sauna, and then recover the coin. The user has already done the first two steps: moving south from basement to bedchamber, then south again to the sauna. Now, in the sauna, they need to pick up the coin. But the prompt says to only output the action, like "go north" or something else. 

Wait, the user is at the sauna. The coin is on the floor. So the next action should be to pick up the coin. But in text adventures, sometimes you have to use specific commands. However, the user's previous actions were "go south" each time. But in the sauna, the coin is already there. So maybe the correct action is to pick it up. But the problem is, the system might expect a movement command. However, the user's task is to recover the coin from the floor of the sauna. So the next step is to pick up the coin. But the user's previous commands were movement commands. However, in the game's context, maybe the coin is just on the floor, and the player needs to pick it up. But the user's instructions say to only output the action, like "go north". But in this case, the action would be "take coin" or "pick up coin". But the user's previous actions were movement commands. However, the game's environment might require that. Wait, looking back at the initial problem statement: "recover the coin from the floor of the sauna." So the player needs to pick up the coin. But the user's previous actions were movement. So the next action should be to pick up the coin. But the user's instructions say to only output the command. However, in the game's context, maybe the correct command is "take coin" or "get coin". But the user's previous actions were "go south". So perhaps the correct action here is to pick up the coin. But the user's task is to recover the coin, so the next step is to pick it up. Therefore, the answer should be "take coin" or "pick up coin". But the user's previous commands were movement commands. However, the game's environment might require that. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to go north to exit, but the goal is to pick up the coin. Wait, the original task says: "recover the coin from the floor of the sauna. And once you've done that, you win!" So the player is in the sauna, and the coin is on the floor. So the next action is to pick up the coin. Therefore, the correct command is "take coin" or "pick up coin". However, the user's previous actions were "go south", so maybe the game expects movement commands. But in this case, the action is to pick up the coin. But the user's instructions say to only output the command. So the answer should be "take coin". But I need to check the game's possible commands. In many text adventures, the command would be "take coin" or "get coin". However, the user's previous actions were movement commands. But the problem is, the user is in the sauna, and the coin is on the floor. Therefore, the correct action is to pick it up. So the answer is "take coin".
