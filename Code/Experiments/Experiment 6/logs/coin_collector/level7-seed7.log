It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, go south. Next, make an attempt to venture east. And then, try to go north. If you can get through with that, attempt to travel north. Then, head west. And then, make an attempt to venture south. With that over with, recover the coin from the floor of the cookhouse. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just shown up in a bedroom.



There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Lounge =-
You find yourself in a lounge. A typical one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Lounge, and they need to figure out the next steps. The original task was to go south, then east, then north, then north again, west, south, and finally get the coin from the cookhouse.

So far, they've gone south from the Bedroom to the Lounge. Now, in the Lounge, the hints say to try going east or north. The user's next action should follow the initial plan. The first step after entering the Lounge would be to go east as per the instruction. But wait, the user's previous action was going south, which was correct. Now, the next step in the task is to venture east. So the next command should be "go east". Then after that, the plan is to go north twice, then west, then south. But the user needs to check if those exits are available. However, the user is supposed to follow the steps as given, so after going east, the next would be north. But the current position is the Lounge. Let me check the environment again.

In the Lounge, the user is told to try going east or north. The original plan says after the initial south, go east, then north. So the next step is to go east. Then, from the east direction, maybe they can go north. But the user needs to make sure each step is possible. However, the user is supposed to follow the steps as instructed, so the next action is "go east".
</think>go east

-= Dish-Pit =-
Well, here we are in the dish-pit.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Dish-Pit =-0/3

Okay, let's see. The user is navigating through different rooms in TextWorld. The original goal was to recover the coin from the cookhouse floor. So far, they've gone south from the bedroom to the lounge, then east to the dish-pit. The current room is the dish-pit, and the available directions are north and west.

The user's next action needs to be determined. The previous steps followed the instruction to go south, then east, then north, etc. But in the dish-pit, the suggested directions are north and west. The user's next move should follow the initial plan, which was to go north after east. But the user is at the dish-pit, so going north from here would be the next step as per the original task. However, the user's last action was go east, leading to the dish-pit. The next step in the original task was to try going north again. But in the dish-pit, the available exits are north and west. So the user should go north again. But wait, the user's previous action was go east, and the next step in the task was to try to go north again. However, in the dish-pit, the user is told to try going north or west. So the next action should be north. But the user's task was to go south, then east, then north, then north again, then west, then south. So after dish-pit, the next step would be north. But the user is in the dish-pit, so going north would be the next step. However, the user's current room is dish-pit, and the next step in the task is to go north again. So the correct next action is go north. But the user has to check if that's possible. The prompt says that in the dish-pit, north is unguarded. So the user should go north. Then, after that, the next step is to head west, then south. But the user's next action is to go north from the dish-pit. So the answer should be go north.

-= Laundry Place =-
You've just shown up in a laundry place.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the game: bedroom, lounge, dish-pit, and now laundry place. The original task was to go south, then east, north, north again, west, south, and then get the coin from the cookhouse.

So far, the user has gone south from the bedroom to the lounge, then east to the dish-pit, north to the laundry place. The next step according to the original plan was to go north again. The laundry place has an exit to the north and south. The user's next action was "go north" which took them to the laundry place. Wait, no, the current location is laundry place. The next step in the plan was after going north from dish-pit to laundry place, then go north again. But the laundry place's north exit is unblocked. So the next action should be go north again. But the user's last action was go north, which led to the laundry place. Wait, maybe the user is at the laundry place now. The next step in the original task was after the first north (from dish-pit to laundry place), then go north again. So the user should go north again from the laundry place. The laundry place has a north exit. So the next command is go north. But the user's last action was go north, which is already done. Wait, maybe the user is at the laundry place, and the next step is to go north again. The user's last action was "go north" which brought them to the laundry place. Now, the next step in the original plan was to go north again. So the next command should be go north again. But the user's next action is to go north again. However, the user's last input was "go north" which led to the laundry place. Now, the current location is laundry place. The next step is to go north again. So the next action is go north. But the user's next move would be to go north again. But the user's last action was go north, which is already done. Wait, maybe the user is at the laundry place, and the next step is to go north again. So the next command is go north. But the user's last action was go north, which is correct. So the answer is go north again.

-= Washroom =-
Well, here we are in a washroom.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.



>                                                                                                                                -= Washroom =-0/5

Okay, let's see. The user is navigating through different rooms in TextWorld. The original goal was to recover the coin from the cookhouse floor. So far, they've gone south from the bedroom to the lounge, then east to the dish-pit, north to the laundry place, and then north again to the washroom.

In the washroom, the提示 says to try going south (which is unblocked) or west. The user's next action should be either of those. But considering the path taken so far, maybe they need to find a way back or move towards the cookhouse. The cookhouse is likely in a different direction. Since the user has been moving north and east, maybe west from the washroom could lead them towards the cookhouse or another area. Alternatively, going south from the washroom would take them back to the laundry place. But the original task is to get to the cookhouse. Maybe the cookhouse is in the west direction from somewhere. But since the user hasn't seen the cookhouse yet, they need to continue exploring. The next step should be either west or south. The user's previous actions have been to go in directions suggested by the prompts. In the washroom, the suggestion is to go west. So maybe the correct next step is west.
</think>go west

-= Parlor =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a parlor. You begin to take stock of what's here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Parlor =-0/6

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the TextWorld game. The original task was to go south, then east, then north, then north again, west, and south, and finally recover the coin from the cookhouse.

So far, the user has gone from Bedroom → Lounge → Dish-Pit → Laundry Place → Washroom → Parlor. The next step in the original plan was to go south from the Parlor. The current room is the Parlor, and the description mentions there's an exit to the south that's unblocked. So the next action should be to go south. That's part of the original sequence, so following that logic makes sense. Also, the user is supposed to recover the coin from the cookhouse, which might be in a southern direction. So going south from the Parlor is the next logical step.

-= Cookhouse =-
You are in a cookhouse. A standard kind of place.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

There is a coin on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user has been moving through different rooms in the TextWorld game. Their goal is to recover the coin from the floor of the cookhouse.

So far, they've gone south from the bedroom, then east to the dish-pit, north to the laundry place, then north again to the washroom, west to the parlor, and south back to the cookhouse. Now they're in the cookhouse, and the coin is on the floor here. The next step is to pick up the coin. But the prompt says to only output the action, like "go north". However, picking up the coin isn't a direction. Wait, maybe the game expects the player to pick it up by interacting with it. But the user's previous actions were all directions. The instruction says to "recover the coin from the floor of the cookhouse". So the correct action here is to pick up the coin. But the game might require using a command like "take coin" or "get coin". However, in TextWorld, the commands are usually directional. But since the coin is on the floor, maybe the player needs to pick it up. But the user's previous actions were all "go" commands. Wait, maybe the game allows picking up items with a command like "take coin". But the user's instructions say to only output the action, like "go north". So perhaps the correct action here is to take the coin. But the user's previous actions were all movement commands. Maybe the game expects "take coin" as the next action. However, the user's task is to recover the coin, so the final step is to pick it up. Therefore, the next action should be "take coin".
