It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, go south. Next, make an attempt to venture east. And then, try to go north.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to navigate through different rooms in TextWorld. The goal is to recover the coin from the cookhouse. So far, they've gone south from the bedroom to the lounge, then east to the dish-pit, north to the laundry place, and then north again to the washroom. Now, in the washroom, the options are to go south or west.

The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. Let me think about the path. The original instructions said to go south, east, north, north, west, and then south. But so far, they've done south, east, north, north, and now they're in the washroom. The next step according to the original plan would be to go west from the washroom. But the user is asking if they're close to the coin in the cookhouse.

Wait, the cookhouse hasn't been mentioned yet. The current location is the washroom. The path from the washroom west would take them to the laundry place? Or maybe another area. But the original plan was to go west from the washroom. Let me check the previous steps again.

After the laundry place, they went north to the washroom. So the washroom is north of the laundry place. From the washroom, going south would take them back to the laundry place, and west might lead to another area. But the cookhouse hasn't been reached yet. The coin is in the cookhouse, so they need to find the cookhouse.

Alternatively, maybe the path from the washroom west leads to the cookhouse. But the user's current step is in the washroom. The next action should be to go west, as per the original plan. But the user is asking if they're close. Since they haven't reached the cookhouse yet, maybe they need to continue exploring.

But the original instructions said after going north from the washroom, they should head west. So the next step would be to go west from the washroom. Then, after that, go south. But the user is asking if they're close. Maybe they are getting closer. Alternatively, maybe the cookhouse is in a different direction. But based on the current path, the next logical step is to go west from the washroom. So the answer should be to go west.

-= Parlor =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a parlor. You begin to take stock of what's here.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.



>                                                                                                                                -= Parlor =-0/6

-= Cookhouse =-
You are in a cookhouse. A standard kind of place.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

There is a coin on the floor.
