I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First step, make an effort to head north. With that over with, make an effort to go east. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the canteen. That's it!

-= Cubicle =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the cubicle.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

-= Laundry Place =-
You've just shown up in a laundry place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Canteen =-
You find yourself in a canteen. A typical kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."



There is an unguarded exit to the west.

There is a coin on the floor.
