Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to try to venture north. After that, head east. That done, go to the east. Next, attempt to travel north. And then, travel west. That done, head south. With that accomplished, make an effort to head west. After that, pick-up the coin from the floor of the steam room. And once you"ve done that, you win!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has followed a specific path. The original goal was to venture north, then east, then north again, west, south, west again, pick up the coin in the steam room, and win. So far, the user has gone from Studio -> Kitchen -> Bedchamber -> Spare Room -> Workshop -> Bar. The current location is the Bar, and the exits are east and south. The next steps according to the original plan were after getting to the Bar, maybe heading south? But the user is asking if they're on the right track.

Looking at the steps: The user was told to go north, then east, then north, west, south, west, then collect the coin. So after the Bar, the next step should be south (as per the original instructions: "after that, head south. With that accomplished, make an effort to head west."). So from the Bar, going south would be the next step. Then west again. Then maybe proceed to the steam room to pick up the coin. So the user is currently at the Bar, and the next action should be to go south. The user is asking if they're close, so the assistant should confirm that they're on track and tell them to go south next.
</think>go south

-= Steam Room =-
Wow! You're in a steam room.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Steam Room =-0/8
Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has reached the Steam Room, which is the target location where they need to pick up the coin. The original goal was to go north, east, north, west, south, west, then pick up the coin in the steam room and win. So far, the user has followed the path correctly. The current step is to pick up the coin. The prompt says there's a coin on the floor, so the next action should be to pick it up. However, in text adventures, sometimes you have to use specific commands like 'take coin' or 'get coin'. But the user's previous actions were all 'go directions', so maybe the game expects 'take' or 'pick up'. But the user's last action was 'go west' to reach the Steam Room. Now, the correct next step is to pick up the coin. The assistant should respond with the command to pick it up. The user is asking if they're close, so the answer is yes, and the next action is to take the coin.
</think>take coin
