Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to make an effort to go to the east. Then, attempt to go to the east. And then, attempt to travel north. After that, lift the coin from the floor of the garage. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Cookhouse =-
You've entered a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the cookhouse. You begin looking for stuff.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Pantry =-
You're now in a pantry.



You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the west.

-= Cookery =-
This cookery you have just entered is definitely ordinary.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Garage =-
You are in a garage. A standard kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.
