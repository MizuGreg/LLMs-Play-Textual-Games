Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, head west. And then, attempt to travel north. Once you manage that, go north. And then, lift the coin from the floor of the chamber. Alright, thanks!

-= Study =-
You arrive in a study. A normal one.



You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

>                                                                                                                                -= Study =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go west
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Laundromat =-
Of every laundromat you could have shown up in, you had to walk into an ordinary one.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go north
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Washroom =-
You're now in a washroom. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Washroom =-0/3
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go north
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Chamber =-
You're now in the chamber.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Chamber =-0/4
AGENT -------------------------------------------------

That's not a verb I recognise.
