Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. Their goal is to navigate through various rooms, move in specific directions, and eventually pick up a coin in a vault. So far, they've moved from the closet south to the spare room, then east to the studio, north to the cellar, then north again to the cookhouse, south back to the cellar, and north again to the cookhouse again. The current room is the cookhouse, and the prompts suggest exiting south or west.

The user is asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to the goal. Let me track their path. The original instructions were to move south, then east, north, north, west, then north again, and finally pick up the coin. But the current position is the cookhouse (room 7). The next steps mentioned in the original task were after moving north from the cookhouse (step 7), then west, then north again, then pick up the coin.

Wait, in the current state, the user is in the cookhouse (room 7). The directions available are south and west. The original plan was after moving north from the cookhouse (step 7), then west. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step should be to go west from the cookhouse. Then, after that, move north again, and then go to the east, then north to reach the vault where the coin is. 

But the user is asking if they're close. Let me check the path again. The user has been moving back and forth between the cellar and cookhouse. Maybe they need to find a way to get to the vault. The vault isn't mentioned yet. So perhaps the next step is to go west from the cookhouse (room 7) to reach another area. Then, after that, move north again to get to the vault. So the next action should be "go west" from the cookhouse. That would be the next logical step towards the vault. The user is on the right track, but needs to continue moving west to reach the vault where the coin is located. So the next command should be "go west".
