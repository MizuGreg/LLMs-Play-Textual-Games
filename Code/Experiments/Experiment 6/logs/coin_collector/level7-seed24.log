Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to head west. And then, attempt to travel north. Once you manage that, go north. And then, make an attempt to venture east. After that, take a trip north. Following that, take a trip west. After that, pick up the coin from the floor of the bedchamber. And if you do that, you're the winner!
