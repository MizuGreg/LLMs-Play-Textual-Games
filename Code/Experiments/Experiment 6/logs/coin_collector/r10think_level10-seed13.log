Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game and has been moving through different locations: laundromat, chamber, closet, canteen, bar, studio, scullery, cookhouse, and now the attic. The original goal mentioned was to pick up a coin from the kitchen floor after moving in certain directions.

First, I need to track the path taken so far. The user started by going west from the laundromat, then south to the chamber, east to the closet, then east again to the canteen, east to the bar, east to the studio, east to the scullery, then north to the cookhouse, and west to the attic. Now, in the attic, the exits are east and south.

The original instructions said to move west, then south, east, east, east, north, west, south, and then pick up the coin in the kitchen. But the user has already moved through several areas. The kitchen hasn't been mentioned yet. The current location is the attic. The exits from the attic are east and south. 

The user's next step should be to check if the kitchen is nearby. Since the user was instructed to go south after moving west in the attic, maybe going south from the attic would lead to the kitchen. Alternatively, going east might lead back towards the studio or another area. But the original plan was to go south after moving west in the attic. So the next action should be to go south from the attic. That would take them towards the kitchen, where the coin is supposed to be. 

Wait, but the user's current location is the attic. The exits are east and south. The original goal was to pick up the coin in the kitchen. So moving south from the attic might lead to the kitchen. Therefore, the next command should be "go south" to reach the kitchen and pick up the coin.

-= Kitchen =-
Okay, so you're in a kitchen, cool, but is it ordinary? You better believe it is.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

There is a coin on the floor.
