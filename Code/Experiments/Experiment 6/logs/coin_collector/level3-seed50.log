Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First stop, try to move north. Once you finish that, make an effort to venture east. And then, pick up the coin from the floor of the basement. And once you"ve done that, you win!

-= Salon =-
You find yourself in a salon. An ordinary kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

>                                                                                                                                -= Salon =-0/1
AGENT -------------------------------------------------
go north
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Spare Room =-
You arrive in a spare room. An usual one. Let's see what's in here.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south.



>                                                                                                                                -= Spare Room =-0/2
AGENT -------------------------------------------------

-= Basement =-
I am obligated to announce that you are now in the basement.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

There is a coin on the floor.


>                                                                                                                                -= Basement =-0/3
