It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be a great idea if you could attempt to move east. That done, head south. Once you manage that, make an attempt to travel east. And then, venture north. Then, make an attempt to go west. Then, go to the south. Then, go south. And then, recover the coin from the floor of the bathroom. Got that? Good!
