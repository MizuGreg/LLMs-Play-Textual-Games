Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to open the chest drawer in the bedroom. After that, pick up the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, look and see that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. Then, open the wooden door inside the bedroom. After that, make an effort to move east. And then, go to the south. And then, recover the half of a bag of chips from the couch. Once you have got the half of a bag of chips, go north. With that over with, put the half of a bag of chips on the stove. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in the bedroom. Let's see what's in here.

You can see a closed chest drawer. You make out an antique trunk. You see a king-size bed. You shudder, but continue examining the king-size bed. The king-size bed is ordinary. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.

Oh, great. Here's a refrigerator. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? The counter is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove. Were you looking for a kitchen island? Because look over there, it's a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Living Room =-
You find yourself in a living room. An ordinary one. You begin looking for stuff.

You see a couch. You see a half of a bag of chips on the couch, so there's that. You can see a low table. You see a remote on the low table. You scan the room for a tv, and you find a tv. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
