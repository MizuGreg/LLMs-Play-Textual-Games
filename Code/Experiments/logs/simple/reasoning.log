Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First, it would be great if you could open the antique trunk in the bedroom. And then, pick up the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. Then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked. And then, open the wooden door within the bedroom. After that, venture east. Once you get around to doing that, open the refrigerator inside the kitchen. After that, take the apple from the refrigerator within the kitchen. And then, place the apple on the stove within the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place.

You can see a chest drawer. You see a closed antique trunk here. You can make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the king-size bed.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user wants me to go through a series of steps in this TextWorld game. So far, I've opened the antique trunk in the bedroom and found an old key. The next step according to the task was to pick up the old key from the trunk. Wait, did I do that already? The response after opening the trunk says the old key is revealed, so maybe I need to take it.

But the user's instruction says after opening the trunk, pick up the key. So I should use the 'take' command. But the game might require specific syntax. Let me check the previous actions. The user's first command was "open antique trunk", which worked. Now, after that, the next step is to pick up the key. So I should type "take old key" or maybe "take key". But the game might have specific names. The trunk has the old key, so maybe the correct command is "take old key".

Wait, the current location is the bedroom, and the key is in the antique trunk. So after opening the trunk, the key is there. So the next action is to take the key. Then, the next step is to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. But how? Maybe use the key to unlock it. So after taking the key, use it on the door. But the door is closed. Wait, the task says to make sure the wooden door is unlocked. So maybe after taking the key, I need to unlock the door with the key. Then open the door.

But the user's instructions also mention going east after opening the door. So the sequence is: open trunk, take key, unlock door, open door, go east. Then proceed to the kitchen, open fridge, take apple, put on stove.

Wait, but the current step is after taking the key. So next, the user needs to unlock the wooden door. But how? Maybe the key is for the door. So "unlock wooden door with old key"? Or "use old key on wooden door". The game might require specific commands. Let me think. In TextWorld, usually, you can use "unlock" or "use" commands. So maybe "unlock wooden door with old key". But the key is already in hand, so perhaps "unlock wooden door".

But the task says to make absolutely sure the door is unlocked. So maybe after taking the key, use it to unlock the door. Then open the door. Then go east.

So the next steps are: take old key, unlock wooden door, open wooden door, go east. Then proceed to the kitchen.

Wait, but in the current state, after opening the trunk and taking the key, the next step is to unlock the door. So the next command should be "unlock wooden door". But maybe the key is needed. So "unlock wooden door with old key". But the game might accept "unlock wooden door" if the key is in hand.

Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is required to unlock it. So the correct command is "unlock wooden door with old key".

But the user's previous action was "open antique trunk", which worked. Then the next step is to take the key. So the next command should be "take old key".

Wait, the user's initial task said: after opening the trunk, pick up the old key. So the next command is "take old key".

So the next step is to take the key. Then, unlock the door. Then open the door. Then go east.

So the next command after opening the trunk is "take old key".

Okay, let's see. The user has already opened the antique trunk and taken the old key. The next step according to the task is to make sure the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. So I need to unlock the door using the key. The command would be "unlock wooden door with old key" or maybe "unlock wooden door". Since the key is in hand, the game might require using the key to unlock it. So the next action is to unlock the door.

After unlocking, the next step is to open the wooden door. So once it's unlocked, the player can open it. Then, they need to go east. So after opening the door, the command would be "go east".

But first, the current location is the bedroom. The wooden door is closed and leading east. So the correct sequence is: unlock the door, then open it, then go east. But maybe the door can be opened once it's unlocked. So the next command is "unlock wooden door". Let me check the previous steps. The user has the key, so using "unlock wooden door" should work. Then, after unlocking, the door is unlocked, so the player can open it. Then go east.

Okay, so the user has unlocked the wooden door. Now the next step is to open the door. Since the door was previously closed and now it's unlocked, the player should be able to open it. The command would be "open wooden door". Let me check the previous interactions. After unlocking, the door is now unlocked, so opening it should be possible. Once it's open, the player can go east as per the task.

So the next action is to open the wooden door. Then, after opening, go east. Let me make sure that the door is indeed openable. The game's response after unlocking didn't mention the door being open, just that it's unlocked. So the next step is to open it. The command would be "open wooden door".

Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.

You can see a closed refrigerator. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. The counter is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You see a stove. The stove is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
