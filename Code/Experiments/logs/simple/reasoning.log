Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to open the chest drawer in the bedroom. After that, pick up the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, look and see that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. Then, open the wooden door inside the bedroom. After that, make an effort to move east. And then, go to the south. And then, recover the half of a bag of chips from the couch. Once you have got the half of a bag of chips, go north. With that over with, put the half of a bag of chips on the stove. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in the bedroom. Let's see what's in here.

You can see a closed chest drawer. You make out an antique trunk. You see a king-size bed. You shudder, but continue examining the king-size bed. The king-size bed is ordinary. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me see. The user wants me to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. So far, I've opened the chest drawer in the bedroom and found an old key. The next step according to the instructions was to pick up the old key from the chest drawer. Wait, the user said "pick up the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom." But in the game's response, after opening the chest drawer, the old key is revealed. So I need to pick it up.

But the game's current state shows that the chest drawer is open, and the old key is there. So the next action should be to take the key. However, the user's instruction says after opening the chest drawer, pick up the key. So I should type "take old key" or "pick up old key". But in the game's context, maybe the correct command is "take old key" or "get old key". Let me check the previous action. The user said "open chest drawer", and the game responded with the key being revealed. So now, the next step is to pick it up. So the correct command here would be "take old key" or "pick up old key". But I need to make sure that the game accepts that command. Since the user hasn't provided any specific commands yet, I should follow the exact instructions given. The user said "pick up the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom." So the command should be "pick up old key". But maybe the game expects "take old key". Alternatively, maybe the key is already in the chest drawer, so after opening it, the player can take it. So the next action is to take the key. Let me check the previous interaction again. The user's first command was "open chest drawer", which worked. Now, the next step is to pick up the key. So the correct command here is "take old key" or "pick up old key". Since the game's response after opening the drawer mentions the key is revealed, I think the next step is to take it. Therefore, the correct command is "take old key".

Okay, let's see. The user has already opened the chest drawer and picked up the old key. The next step according to the instructions is to check if the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. Wait, the user said "look and see that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked." So I need to examine the door to confirm it's unlocked. But in the game's current state, the wooden door leading east is closed. Wait, the initial description said there's a closed wooden door leading east. So maybe the door is closed but not locked? Or is it locked? The user's instruction says to check if it's unlocked. So perhaps the next action is to try opening it. But the user's instruction says to first look and see if it's unlocked. So maybe the command is "look at wooden door" or "examine wooden door". But in the game's context, maybe the correct command is "open wooden door" if it's unlocked. However, the door is closed. Wait, the initial description says the door is closed. So maybe the user needs to open it. But the user's instruction says to check if it's unlocked first. So perhaps the door is unlocked but closed, so the player can open it. So the next step is to open the wooden door. The user's instruction says after picking up the key, check if the door is unlocked, then open it. So the command would be "open wooden door". Let me check the previous steps again. The user's instructions say: after picking up the key, "look and see that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. Then, open the wooden door inside the bedroom." So first, check if it's unlocked. But how? Maybe the game allows examining the door. So the command would be "look at wooden door" or "examine wooden door". But the user's instruction says to "look and see that it's unlocked", so maybe the game will confirm that. Then, after confirming, open it. So the next action is to open the door. But the door is closed. So perhaps the correct command is "open wooden door". Let me proceed with that.

Okay, so the user tried to open the wooden door, but the game responded that they need to unlock it with the old key first. That makes sense. The previous steps were opening the chest drawer, taking the key, and now the door is closed but locked. So the next logical step is to use the key to unlock the door. The command should be "unlock wooden door with old key" or something similar. But in the game's context, maybe the correct command is "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door". Let me check the possible commands. Since the key is in hand, the player needs to use it on the door. So the correct action is to unlock the door with the key. Therefore, the next command should be "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". The game might accept either, but since the user has the key, using it on the door is the right move. So I'll proceed with "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has unlocked the wooden door. Now the next step according to the instructions is to "make an effort to move east." So after opening the door, they need to go east. The command would be "go east" or "move east". Since the door was leading east, moving east should be the next action. Then, after moving east, the user needs to "go to the south." Wait, the instructions say after moving east, go south. So after entering the room beyond the door (probably a new room), the player needs to move south. Then, recover the half of a bag of chips from the couch. So once in that room, look for the couch and pick up the chips. Then go north, put the chips on the stove, and win. But the current step is after unlocking the door, so the next command is "go east". Let me confirm the current state. The user is in the bedroom, just unlocked the door leading east. So the next action is to move east into the adjacent room. The command should be "go east".

Okay, the user tried to move east but the game said they have to open the wooden door first. Wait, but they just unlocked it. Maybe there's a confusion here. Let me check the previous steps. The user unlocked the door, and the game said "You unlock wooden door." Then the user tried to go east, but the game says they need to open it first. That doesn't make sense because they just unlocked it. Maybe the game considers "unlock" and "open" as different actions. Perhaps the door is unlocked but still closed, so they need to open it. So the correct step is to open the door again. But the user already unlocked it. Hmm, maybe the game's response is a mistake, but according to the game's message, they need to open it. So the next command should be "open wooden door" again. But the user already did that. Wait, maybe the door is locked again? No, the user just unlocked it. This is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the game requires the player to open the door after unlocking. But in reality, unlocking allows opening. Maybe the game's message is incorrect, but the user has to follow it. So the next action is to open the door again. But the user already did that. Maybe the game is in a loop. Alternatively, perhaps the door is closed but unlocked, so the player needs to open it. So the correct command is "open wooden door". Let me proceed with that.

You've just sauntered into a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.

Oh, great. Here's a refrigerator. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? The counter is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove. Were you looking for a kitchen island? Because look over there, it's a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen now. The next steps according to the instructions are: after moving east (but wait, the user just moved east into the kitchen from the bedroom), then go south. Wait, the original instructions said after moving east, go to the south. But the user is in the kitchen now. The kitchen has exits to the north, south, east, and west. The user needs to go south from the kitchen. So the next command should be "go south". But let me check the instructions again. The user's original plan was: after opening the door in the bedroom, move east, then go south. But in the kitchen, the user is now in the kitchen. So from the kitchen, going south would take them to another room. But the instructions say after moving east (from the bedroom), go south. So perhaps the user needs to go south from the kitchen. But the kitchen's south exit is unguarded. So the command is "go south". Let me confirm the current state. The user is in the kitchen, and the next step is to go south. So the correct command is "go south".

You find yourself in a living room. An ordinary one. You begin looking for stuff.

You see a couch. You see a half of a bag of chips on the couch, so there's that. You can see a low table. You see a remote on the low table. You scan the room for a tv, and you find a tv. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
