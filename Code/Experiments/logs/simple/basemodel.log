Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First, it would be great if you could open the antique trunk in the bedroom. And then, pick up the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. Then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked. And then, open the wooden door within the bedroom. After that, venture east. Once you get around to doing that, open the refrigerator inside the kitchen. After that, take the apple from the refrigerator within the kitchen. And then, place the apple on the stove within the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place.

You can see a chest drawer. You see a closed antique trunk here. You can make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the king-size bed.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.

You can see a closed refrigerator. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. The counter is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You see a stove. The stove is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
