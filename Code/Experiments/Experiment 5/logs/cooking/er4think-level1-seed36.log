You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the kitchen.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains a white onion, a raw white tuna and a red onion. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. This always happens!

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They found the cookbook but couldn't open it. Then they looked around but couldn't see anything. Now they're asking if they're on the right track and what the next move should be.

First, I need to recall the items in the kitchen. The fridge has a white onion, raw white tuna, and a red onion. The counter has a cookbook and a knife. The oven, stove, and table are present but empty. The user has the cookbook, but it's not openable. Maybe the cookbook is a clue for the recipe. Since they can't open it, maybe they need to find another way to get the ingredients or follow the recipe steps.

Wait, the user has the knife. Maybe they need to use the knife to prepare the ingredients. But the ingredients are in the fridge. They need to take the onions and tuna from the fridge. Then, perhaps cook them using the stove or oven. But the stove is empty. Maybe the user needs to put the ingredients on the stove. However, the cookbook might have the steps, but since it's not openable, maybe the user needs to find another way. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is a book that needs to be read, but since it's not openable, perhaps the user needs to look for a different action.

Wait, the user tried to open the cookbook but couldn't. Maybe the cookbook is not a book but a container? Or maybe the user needs to use the knife to cut the onions. But the user hasn't taken the ingredients yet. So the next step might be to take the onions from the fridge. Let me check the items again. The fridge has white onion, raw white tuna, and red onion. The user is in the kitchen, so they can take those items. Then, maybe use the knife to cut them. Then, cook them on the stove. But the user hasn't taken any items yet. So the next action should be to take the onions from the fridge. Let me make sure. The user is in the kitchen, and the fridge is there. So the correct next step is to take the white onion and red onion from the fridge. Then, maybe use the knife to prepare them. Then, use the stove to cook. But the user hasn't taken any items yet. So the next action should be to take the onions. Let me check the previous steps again. The user picked up the cookbook, but couldn't open it. Then looked around but couldn't see anything. So maybe the next step is to take the onions from the fridge. So the command would be "take white onion" and "take red onion" or something similar. But in the game, the user can only take one item at a time. So maybe the user should take the white onion first. Alternatively, the user might need to check the fridge again. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the fridge is visible. So the next action is to take the onions from the fridge. So the correct command is "take white onion" and "take red onion". But the user might need to take them one by one. So the next action is to take the white onion from the fridge.

Okay, the user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They've taken the white and red onions from the fridge and have a knife. The previous attempt to "use knife on white onion" was incorrect. The game probably expects a different command. Maybe they need to cut the onion with the knife first. So the correct action would be "cut white onion with knife". Let me check the possible commands. Since the user has the knife, they can use it to cut the onion. So the next step is to cut the onion. Then, maybe put it on the stove. But the user needs to follow the recipe from the cookbook, but since it's not openable, maybe the steps are implied. So the next action is to cut the onion with the knife.

Okay, the user is trying to cut the white onion with the knife. The game keeps saying that "cut white onion with knife" is not understood. Maybe the correct command is different. Perhaps it's "cut white onion" without mentioning the knife, since the knife is already in hand. Or maybe "use knife on white onion" is the right syntax. Wait, the user tried "use knife on white onion" before, but the game said that's not a verb. Maybe the correct command is "cut white onion" alone, assuming the knife is available. Let me try that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first use the knife on the onion. But the game doesn't accept "use knife on white onion". Hmm. Maybe the correct command is "cut white onion" without the knife. Let me try that.

You need to specify how you want to cut the white onion. Either slice, dice, or chop it.

Okay, the user is trying to slice the white onion but the game is asking what they want to slice it with. They have a knife in their inventory. So the next step is to use the knife to slice the onion. The correct command should be "slice white onion with knife". Let me check if that's the right syntax. The game previously accepted "use knife on white onion", but that wasn't working. Maybe "slice white onion with knife" is the correct command. Alternatively, "cut white onion with knife" might be the right way. But the user tried "cut white onion with knife" and it didn't work. Hmm. The game says "What do you want to slice the white onion with?" so the user needs to specify the tool, which is the knife. So the command should be "slice white onion with knife". Let me try that.
