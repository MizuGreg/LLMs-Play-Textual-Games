You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

You can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a carrot and an orange bell pepper. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper, a raw red tuna, a yellow bell pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.
