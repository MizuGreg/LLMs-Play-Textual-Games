You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A standard kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.

Were you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains a red onion, a raw red potato, a yellow onion and a yellow bell pepper. You make out a closed oven. You can make out a table. However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. You see a tomato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the cookbook. The recipe says to dice the red onion, fry it, and prepare the meal. So far, they've tried to open the cookbook, which was closed, then looked around but couldn't find anything else. Then they tried to look at the cookbook, which they could, and started reading the recipe.

Now, the user tried to "dice red onion" but the system responded that cutting requires a knife. Then they tried "use knife on red onion", but that wasn't a recognized verb. The user is now asking if they're on the right track and what their next action should be.

So, the problem here is that the user tried to use the knife on the onion, but the game's response didn't accept that command. The correct action would be to use the knife to dice the onion. But since "use knife on red onion" wasn't recognized, maybe the correct command is "cut red onion with knife" or "dice red onion with knife". Alternatively, maybe the game expects the user to first take the knife, then use it on the onion.

Wait, in the kitchen, the user found a knife on the counter. So the steps would be: take the knife, then use it to dice the onion. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So maybe the next step is to take the knife first. But the user's last action was "use knife on red onion", which didn't work. So perhaps the correct command is "take knife", then "cut red onion".

But the user is at the step where they have the red onion and the knife. The recipe says to dice the red onion. So the correct action is to use the knife to dice it. But the game's previous response said that "use knife on red onion" wasn't a recognized verb. Maybe the correct command is "cut red onion" or "dice red onion", but the game requires using the knife. So maybe the correct command is "cut red onion with knife" or "dice red onion with knife".

Alternatively, maybe the game expects the user to first take the knife, then use it. So the next step should be "take knife", then "cut red onion".

But the user is asking if they're close to the goal. The current state is that they have the red onion and the knife. The next logical step is to use the knife to dice the onion. Since "use knife on red onion" didn't work, maybe the correct command is "cut red onion with knife".

But the game's previous response said that "use knife on red onion" was not a recognized verb. So perhaps the correct command is "cut red onion" without mentioning the knife, but that might not work. Alternatively, maybe the game expects the user to first take the knife, then use it.

So the next action should be "take knife", then "cut red onion". But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the correct next step is to take the knife first. Therefore, the answer should be "take knife".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to dice the red onion, fry it, and prepare the meal. So far, they've tried to open the cookbook, looked around, and found the knife. They took the knife and tried to cut the red onion with it, but the game didn't recognize the command. The user is now asking if they're on the right track.

Hmm, the previous action was "cut red onion with knife", but the game responded that it only understood up to wanting to cut the onion. Maybe the correct command is just "cut red onion" without specifying the knife, since the knife is already in hand. Alternatively, maybe the game expects the user to use the knife first. Wait, the user already took the knife, so maybe the next step is to simply cut the onion. The recipe says "dice the red onion", so perhaps the correct command is "dice red onion". Let me check the previous steps again.

The user had the red onion and the knife. They tried "use knife on red onion" which didn't work. Then they tried "cut red onion with knife" which the game didn't recognize. So maybe the correct command is "cut red onion" or "dice red onion". Since the recipe says "dice", maybe "dice red onion" is the right command. Let's go with that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to dice the red onion using the knife. They've tried "use knife on red onion" but got a "not a verb" error. The previous command was "dice red onion", which didn't work. The game requires a valid action.

Maybe the correct command is "cut red onion with knife" instead of "use knife on red onion". The game might expect the verb "cut" followed by the object and tool. Alternatively, "slice red onion with knife". Since "dice" didn't work, perhaps "cut" is the right verb here. Let's try "cut red onion with knife".

Okay, the user is trying to fry the red onion. The game says "fry red onion" isn't a recognized verb. Previous steps involved using the knife to dice the onion. Maybe the correct command is "cook red onion" or "saute red onion". Alternatively, maybe "fry" needs to be part of a different structure. Let's think about possible verbs. "Heat pan" was tried but not recognized. Maybe "fry" is a noun here. Wait, the recipe says "fry the red onion", so perhaps the correct command is "fry red onion" but the game expects a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe "cook red onion" or "heat red onion". But the user has to follow the recipe's directions. Since "fry" is in the recipe, maybe the correct command is "fry red onion" even if it's not recognized.

Okay, the user is stuck on the "fry red onion" command. The game keeps saying it's not a recognized verb. Let me think about possible commands. The recipe says "fry the red onion", so maybe the correct verb is "cook" instead of "fry". Or perhaps "heat" the onion. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove first. Wait, the stove is in the kitchen, but the user hasn't interacted with it yet. Maybe the correct sequence is to "heat stove" then "fry onion". But the user has the knife and the onion.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user has successfully fried the red onion and prepared the meal. The next step would be to enjoy the meal. But according to the recipe, the directions are to "prepare the meal" which they did. Since the game's previous action was "prepare meal", which added the meal to inventory, the next logical step is to eat it. But the game might expect a specific command. The user's goal was to cook a delicious meal and enjoy it. So the final action is to eat the meal. The correct command would be "eat meal" or "consume meal". Let's check if that's the right action.
