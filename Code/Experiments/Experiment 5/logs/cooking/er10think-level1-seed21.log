You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

Well, here we are in a kitchen.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out a closed conventional looking oven in the room. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can see a counter. On the counter you can make out a green hot pepper, a green bell pepper, a red bell pepper, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a yellow apple and a knife. You make out a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe says to chop the green hot pepper, fry it, and then prepare the meal. So far, they've taken the cookbook and tried to open it, but it wasn't possible. Then they looked at the cookbook and found the recipe. Now, they've tried to chop the green hot pepper, but the game response says they need a knife.

Wait, the user has a knife on the counter. The ingredients listed include a knife. So the next step is to use the knife to chop the pepper. But the user just tried to chop it without the knife, which wasn't possible. So the correct action would be to take the knife first, then use it to chop the pepper.

But the user's last action was "chop green hot pepper", which failed because they didn't have the knife. So the next step is to take the knife from the counter. Then, after taking the knife, they can chop the pepper. Once chopped, they need to fry it. Then follow the directions to prepare the meal. So the immediate next action should be to take the knife.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to chop the green hot pepper, but they need to use the knife. The game says that "chop" requires a knife. The user tried "use knife on green hot pepper" but got an error. Maybe the correct command is "chop green hot pepper with knife" or something similar. But the game might expect a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe after taking the knife, they can just chop the pepper again. Since the previous attempt to chop failed without the knife, but now they have the knife, perhaps the next step is to try chopping again, using the knife. The game might accept "chop green hot pepper" again since the knife is now in hand. Let me check the previous steps. The user took the knife, so maybe the correct action is to chop the pepper again. The error message was about the verb, but maybe the game expects "chop" to be used again. So the next action should be "chop green hot pepper".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. They've already chopped the green hot pepper using the knife. The next step in the recipe is to fry the green hot pepper. So, the next action should be to fry it. But how do you fry it in the game? The available commands include 'fry', but I need to check if that's a valid command here. Looking at the list of available commands, there's 'fry' not explicitly listed, but maybe it's part of the allowed actions. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the stove. The recipe says to fry the pepper, so perhaps the next step is to use the stove to fry it. The command might be 'fry green hot pepper on stove' or something similar. But since the game's available commands don't have 'fry', maybe the correct command is 'use stove to fry green hot pepper'. Wait, the user has a stove in the kitchen. So the next step is to fry the chopped pepper using the stove. The correct command would be 'fry green hot pepper' or 'use stove to fry green hot pepper'. Since the game allows using the stove, maybe the command is 'fry green hot pepper'. Let me check the previous steps. The user has the knife and the chopped pepper. So the next action is to fry it. The command should be 'fry green hot pepper'.

Okay, the user is trying to fry the green hot pepper. The available commands include 'fry', but the game might not recognize it. Looking at the previous attempts, the user tried "fry green hot pepper" and got an error. Maybe the correct command is to use the stove first. The available commands list includes 'use stove to fry...', but the user might need to specify the action correctly. Alternatively, maybe the game expects a different phrasing, like 'fry the green hot pepper on the stove'. But since the user can't use verbs like 'fry' directly, perhaps the correct command is 'use stove to cook green hot pepper'. Wait, the recipe says "fry the green hot pepper", so maybe the correct action is to use the stove to fry it. The command should be 'fry green hot pepper with stove' or similar. But the game's available commands don't have 'fry' as a verb. Maybe the correct command is 'use stove to fry green hot pepper'. Let me check the available commands again. The list includes 'use ... to ...', so perhaps the correct command is 'use stove to fry green hot pepper'. But the user tried that and got an error. Maybe the game expects a different structure. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to cook the pepper on the stove. The correct command might be 'cook green hot pepper on stove'. But the game's available commands don't have 'cook'. Hmm. The user has to follow the recipe's directions. The next step is to fry the pepper. Since the game doesn't recognize 'fry', maybe the correct command is 'use stove to cook green hot pepper'. But the user might need to use the correct verb. Alternatively, maybe the game expects 'fry' as a verb. But the user tried that and got an error. Maybe the correct command is 'fry green hot pepper' even though it's not recognized. Wait, the user's last attempt was 'fry green hot pepper' and got an error. The game might not have a 'fry' command. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove to cook the pepper. The command would be 'use stove to cook green hot pepper'. But the game's available commands don't have 'cook'. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove's function. The correct command might be 'cook green hot pepper on stove'. But since the game's available commands don't have 'cook', maybe the user needs to use a different approach. The user has to follow the recipe's directions, so the next step is to fry the pepper. The correct command is probably 'fry green hot pepper', even if it's not recognized. But the user needs to find the right command. Maybe the game expects 'fry' as a verb. The user tried it and got an error, but maybe that's the correct command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove first. The correct command is 'use stove to fry green hot pepper'. But the game says that's not a verb. Maybe the correct command is 'fry green hot pepper on stove'. But the game doesn't recognize it. The user is stuck here. The next action should be to try 'fry green hot pepper' again, even though it's not recognized. Alternatively, maybe the game expects 'cook' instead of 'fry'. But the recipe says 'fry'. The user has to proceed with the correct command, even if it's not recognized. The answer is to use the correct command as per the recipe, which is 'fry green hot pepper'.
