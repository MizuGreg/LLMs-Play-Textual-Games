You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You've entered a kitchen.

You make out a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a lettuce, a carrot, a red onion, a red bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You make out an oven. You can make out a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw purple potato and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a kitchen, and their goal is to cook a meal. They found a cookbook on the table, but it wasn't openable. So the next step would be to figure out how to proceed.

First, the user tried to open the cookbook, but it wasn't possible. Maybe the cookbook is locked or needs a key. But in the kitchen, the items available are fridge, oven, table, counter, stove. The counter has a raw purple potato and a knife. The fridge has cheese, lettuce, carrot, red onion, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper. 

Since the cookbook isn't openable, maybe the user needs to find a recipe. Alternatively, maybe they can use the ingredients from the fridge and the counter to make a dish. The stove is there, so perhaps they need to cook something. The user might need to use the knife to prepare the ingredients. 

Wait, the user's previous action was to open the cookbook, which didn't work. So maybe the next step is to look for another way to get a recipe. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is on the table, and the user needs to take it. But the user didn't take it yet. Wait, the initial description said the cookbook is on the table. So maybe the user needs to pick it up first. But the user hasn't done that yet. 

Wait, the user's last action was "open cookbook", but it wasn't possible. So maybe the cookbook is not openable, but the user can take it. So the next step would be to take the cookbook from the table. Then, maybe after taking it, they can find a way to open it. But the user might need to use the knife to cut something, or maybe the stove to cook. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the ingredients from the fridge and the counter to make a meal. Since the cookbook isn't openable, maybe the user needs to proceed without it. But the game might require following a recipe. 

Wait, the user's goal is to cook a meal. So perhaps the next step is to take the cookbook, then look for a recipe. But since the cookbook isn't openable, maybe the user needs to find another way. Alternatively, maybe the user can use the ingredients to make a dish. For example, using the potato, onion, peppers, and other vegetables to make a stir-fry or something. 

But the game might require following a specific recipe. Since the user can't open the cookbook, maybe they need to find another way. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove to cook the ingredients. So the next action could be to take the cookbook, then use the stove. But the user hasn't taken the cookbook yet. 

Wait, the initial description says the cookbook is on the table. So the user needs to take it first. The user's previous action was trying to open it, which didn't work. So the next step should be to take the cookbook. Then, maybe after taking it, they can find a way to open it. But the user might need to use the knife to cut the cookbook, but that's not logical. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove to cook the ingredients. The stove is there, so maybe the user can start cooking. But the user needs a recipe. Since the cookbook isn't openable, maybe the user is stuck. 

Wait, the user is in a kitchen, and the goal is to cook a meal. The user has the ingredients. Maybe the user can just use the stove to cook the ingredients. So the next step is to take the cookbook, then use the stove. But the user hasn't taken the cookbook yet. 

So the correct next action is to take the cookbook from the table. Then, maybe after taking it, the user can find a recipe. But the user can't open it yet. Alternatively, maybe the user can use the ingredients to make a meal without the recipe. But the game might require following the recipe. 

In this case, the user's next action should be to take the cookbook. So the answer is "take cookbook".

Okay, let's see. The user is in a kitchen game where they need to cook a meal. They found the cookbook, took it, and now they're at step 3. The original goal was to cook a delicious meal by checking the cookbook for a recipe.

So far, they've checked the fridge for ingredients (cheese, lettuce, carrot, red onion, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper), found an oven, a table with a cookbook, a counter with a raw purple potato and a knife, and a stove. The stove is conventional but empty. They took the cookbook from the table.

Now, the next logical step would be to look at the cookbook to find a recipe. But the user tried to open it earlier and it wasn't possible. Then they took it, so maybe now they can open it. Wait, the previous attempt to open the cookbook failed, but maybe after taking it, they can open it. So the next action should be to open the cookbook again. But the user's last action was taking the cookbook, so the next step is to open it. However, the system message says to only output the action, like "go north". So the correct next command is to open the cookbook. But the user already took it, so maybe the action is to open it now. The answer should be "open cookbook".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. The goal is to check the cookbook for a recipe and then enjoy the meal. So far, they've entered the kitchen, found the cookbook on the table, tried to open it, but it wasn't possible. Then they took the cookbook, but couldn't open it again. Now, they need to figure out the next step.

Looking at the available commands, the user might need to examine the cookbook more closely. Maybe it's closed or needs to be opened in a different way. The previous attempts to open it failed, so perhaps using the 'examine' command would help understand if it's locked or if there's a different method. Alternatively, checking the inventory to see if they have anything needed to open it. But the user already has the cookbook. Wait, maybe the cookbook is on the table and they need to open it by using the 'open' command again, but the system said it wasn't something you can open. Maybe it's a book that needs to be opened manually, so examining it might reveal that. So the next step should be to examine the cookbook to see if there's a way to open it or if it's already openable.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. The recipe from the cookbook says to dice the block of cheese, roast it, and prepare the meal. So the first step is to dice the cheese.

The user already took the cookbook and tried to open it, but it wasn't possible. Then they examined the cookbook, and the recipe appeared. Now, the next logical step is to get the cheese. The fridge has a block of cheese. So the user needs to take the cheese from the fridge.

Wait, the current location is the kitchen. The fridge is in the kitchen. The user can take the cheese from the fridge. So the command should be "take block of cheese from fridge". But in the available commands, there's "take ... from ...", so that's the correct syntax. Let me check the available commands again. Yes, "take block of cheese from fridge" is a valid command. That should get the cheese into the inventory. Then, the user can proceed to dice it as per the recipe.

So far, they've taken the block of cheese from the fridge. The next step would be to dice it. But how do you dice it? The user has a knife on the counter. So they need to use the knife to dice the cheese.

Wait, the available commands include 'examine' and 'use' maybe? But the commands listed don't have 'use'. The user has a knife in their inventory? Let me check the previous steps. The user took the block of cheese from the fridge. The knife was on the counter, but they didn't pick it up yet. So maybe they need to take the knife first. But the recipe says to dice the cheese, which would require the knife. So the next step is to take the knife from the counter. Then, use it to dice the cheese. But the command for that might be 'dice' or 'cut'. However, the available commands don't include 'dice'. The user can 'examine' the knife, but to perform an action, maybe they need to use the knife on the cheese. Alternatively, the command might be 'cut block of cheese with knife'. But the available commands are limited. Let me check the available commands again.

The available commands include 'examine', 'take', 'put', 'open', 'close', 'drop', 'go', 'look', 'goal', 'inventory', 'eat', 'insert', 'lock', 'unlock'. So the user needs to use the knife to dice the cheese. But how? Maybe the command is 'cut block of cheese with knife', but that's not in the list. Alternatively, the user might need to 'examine' the knife to see if it's usable. Wait, the user has the cheese in their inventory now. They need to dice it. Maybe the correct command is 'cut block of cheese' using the knife. But since the command list doesn't have 'cut', perhaps the correct action is to 'examine' the knife first. But the user already has the cheese. Alternatively, maybe the next step is to 'roast' the cheese, but the recipe says to dice first. So the user needs to dice the cheese. Since the knife is on the counter, they need to take it first. So the next action should be 'take knife from counter'. Then, use it to dice the cheese. But the command for dicing might be 'dice block of cheese', but that's not in the list. Alternatively, the user might need to 'examine' the cheese to see if it's diced. Hmm, maybe the correct next step is to 'examine knife' to see if it's usable. But the user's goal is to follow the recipe.

Wait, the user has the cheese and the knife. The next logical step would be to dice the cheese. But in the game, the command needs to be in the right format. The available commands include "examine" and "use" maybe? Or perhaps "cut" something with the knife.

Looking back at the available commands, there's "examine" and "use" isn't listed. But the user has the knife and the cheese. So maybe they need to use the knife to dice the cheese. But the command structure might require something like "cut block of cheese with knife" or "dice block of cheese with knife." However, the game might have specific commands. 

Alternatively, since the recipe says "dice the block of cheese," maybe the correct command is "dice block of cheese." But the user has the knife, so maybe they need to use it. But the available commands don't include a "cut" or "dice" command. The user might need to use the knife to perform the action. 

Wait, the previous action was taking the knife. Now, the next step is to use the knife on the cheese. The command might be "cut block of cheese with knife" or "use knife on block of cheese." But looking at the available commands, there's "examine" and "eat," but maybe "cut" isn't a valid command. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "examine" the cheese to see if it's diced. But the recipe says to dice it first. So the correct action is to dice the cheese. Since the user has the knife, they need to use it to dice the cheese. The game might accept "cut block of cheese with knife" as the command. But I need to check the available commands again. The available commands include "use" but it's not listed here. Wait, the available commands listed earlier don't include "use," but the user can use the knife to cut the cheese. 

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "cut block of cheese with knife." But the game might require a specific format. Since the user has the knife and the cheese, the next step is to dice the cheese. So the command would be "dice block of cheese with knife." But I need to make sure that's the correct format. Alternatively, maybe "cut block of cheese" is sufficient, assuming the knife is in hand. 

Wait, the user just took the knife, so they have it. So the next step is to use the knife to dice the cheese. The correct command might be "cut block of cheese with knife." But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the game expects "dice block of cheese." Let me check the previous steps. The user took the cheese and the knife. The recipe says to dice it. So the next action is to dice the cheese. The command would be "dice block of cheese." But if the knife is needed, maybe "cut block of cheese with knife." But the game's available commands don't have "cut," but "examine" is there. Hmm. Maybe the correct command is "cut block of cheese with knife." But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe "use knife on block of cheese." But the available commands don't include "use." 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "examine" the cheese after taking it. But the user already has the cheese. Wait, the recipe says to dice the cheese, so the next step is to perform that action.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to "dice the block of cheese," "roast the block of cheese," and then "prepare meal." So far, they've taken the cheese from the fridge and the knife from the counter. Then they tried to cut the cheese with the knife. But the system responded that it only understood up to cutting the cheese.

Wait, the recipe says "dice" the cheese, which is similar to cutting, but maybe the system expects a specific command. The user tried "cut block of cheese with knife," but the system didn't recognize that. Maybe the correct command is "dice" instead of "cut"? Or perhaps the system requires a different phrasing.

Alternatively, maybe after cutting, the next step is roasting. But the user needs to put the cheese in the oven. So after dicing, they need to roast it. But the system might require the exact command. Let me check the available commands again. The user can use "roast" as a command. So maybe after dicing, they should roast the cheese in the oven.

But the user's last action was "cut block of cheese with knife," which the system didn't recognize. So maybe the correct command is "dice" instead. Let me think. The recipe says "dice the block of cheese," so maybe the user needs to use "dice block of cheese with knife." But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "cut" but with the correct syntax.

Wait, the available commands include "cut ... with ...". So maybe the correct command is "cut block of cheese with knife". But the system said it only understood up to cutting. Maybe the system is expecting "dice" as the action. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first cut the cheese, then put it in the oven to roast.

But the user's next action should be to roast the cheese. So after dicing, they need to roast it. So the next command would be "roast block of cheese in oven". But the system might require the exact command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to put the cheese in the oven first.

Wait, the oven is in the kitchen. So the user needs to put the cheese in the oven and then roast it. But the recipe says to roast the block of cheese. So maybe the correct sequence is: dice the cheese, then roast it in the oven.

But the user tried to cut it, and the system didn't recognize that. So maybe the correct command is "dice block of cheese with knife". Let me check the available commands again. The user can use "examine", "look", "inventory", "go", "examine", "eat", "open", "close", "drop", "take", "put", "take from", "insert into", "lock with", "unlock with".

So the user needs to perform the action as per the recipe. The recipe says "dice the block of cheese", so the correct command would be "dice block of cheese with knife". But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "cut" instead of "dice".

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first cut the cheese into dice, then roast it. So the next step after cutting is to roast it. But the system might require the exact command. Since the user tried "cut block of cheese with knife" and the system didn't recognize it, maybe the correct command is "dice block of cheese with knife".

But the user's last action was "cut block of cheese with knife", which the system didn't recognize. So the next step would be to roast the cheese. So the user should try "roast block of cheese in oven". But the oven is in the kitchen. So the command would be "roast block of cheese in oven".

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to put the cheese in the oven first. So "put block of cheese in oven", then "roast".

But according to the recipe, after dicing, the next step is to roast. So the user needs to roast the cheese. Therefore, the next command should be "roast block of cheese in oven".

Maybe "put block of cheese in oven" or "place block of cheese in oven". Alternatively, maybe "roast block of cheese" is the correct command, but the system is picky. Since the user tried "roast block of cheese in oven" and it didn't work, maybe the correct command is just "roast block of cheese" without specifying the oven. Or perhaps the oven needs to be interacted with first.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to open the oven first. Wait, the oven is conventional, but the user hasn't interacted with it yet. So maybe the correct step is to put the cheese in the oven. Let me check the available commands again. The user can "put ... on ..." or "insert ... into ...". So maybe "put block of cheese in oven" is the right command. But the system might expect "roast" as a verb. But since the system said "That's not a verb I recognise," perhaps "roast" isn't a valid command here. So the user needs to use the oven's function. Maybe the correct command is "put block of cheese in oven". Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to roast the block of cheese in the oven. They tried "roast block of cheese in oven" but the system said that's not a recognized verb. Then they tried "put block of cheese in oven", but the oven is closed.

So the next step would be to open the oven first. Since the oven is closed, they can't put the cheese inside. The available commands include "open" for doors or containers. The oven is a container here, so they need to open it before putting the cheese in. Let me check the available commands again. Yes, "open oven" is a valid command. So the correct action is to open the oven first.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen game. They've followed the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to dice the cheese, roast it, and prepare the meal. So far, they've taken the cheese from the fridge, got the knife, cut the cheese, and put it in the oven. But the oven was closed, so they had to open it first.

Now, the oven is open. The next step would be to roast the cheese. But the user tried "roast block of cheese in oven" and the system said that's not a recognized verb. So maybe the correct command is to put the cheese in the oven, but since it's already there, maybe they need to trigger the roasting action. Alternatively, maybe the oven needs to be turned on or something. But looking at the available commands, there's "put" and "open". Since the oven is open now, perhaps the next step is to close it again to roast the cheese. Wait, but the recipe says to roast it. Maybe the action is just putting it in and then closing the oven. But the user already put it in after opening. Hmm.

Wait, the user put the cheese in the oven when it was closed. Then they opened the oven, but the cheese was already inside. So maybe the next step is to close the oven again to start roasting. But the oven was opened, so maybe they need to close it. Alternatively, maybe the system expects the user to use the "roast" command with the oven. But the system didn't recognize "roast" as a verb. So perhaps the correct action is to close the oven, which would allow the cheese to roast. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user tried "roast block of cheese in oven" which was invalid. Then they tried "put block of cheese in oven" which worked, but the oven was closed. Then they opened the oven. Now the oven is open. So maybe the next step is to close the oven again to roast the cheese. So the command would be "close oven". That makes sense because the oven needs to be closed to roast the food. So the next action should be closing the oven.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe from the cookbook. So far, they've taken the block of cheese from the fridge, picked up the knife from the counter, and tried to cut and roast the cheese. But there were some issues with the commands, like "roast" not being recognized, and the oven being closed.

The current step was closing the oven again. Now, the user needs to proceed towards completing the recipe. The recipe says to "roast the block of cheese," so maybe the next step is to actually put the cheese in the oven and then roast it. But since the oven was just closed, maybe they need to open it again, place the cheese inside, and then roast it. However, the user might not have the correct command for roasting. Alternatively, maybe after putting the cheese in the oven, they need to leave it there, and the game might automatically consider it as roasting. But the user has to follow the steps correctly.

Looking at the previous actions, the user tried "roast block of cheese in oven," which wasn't recognized. So perhaps the correct command is "put block of cheese in oven" after opening it. Since the oven was closed, they had to open it, put the cheese in, then close it. But the recipe says to roast it, so maybe the next step is to leave it in the oven, and the game will process that as roasting. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use a different command like "roast" without specifying the oven. But according to the available commands, "roast" isn't a direct action. The user might need to use "put" to place the cheese in the oven and then close it, which would simulate roasting. Since the user already put the cheese in the oven and closed it, maybe the next step is to check if the cheese is roasted, but the game might require a specific command. However, the user's last action was closing the oven, so the next logical step would be to check if the cheese is ready or if they need to do something else. But according to the recipe, after roasting, they need to prepare the meal. So maybe the final step is to eat the roasted cheese. But the user has to follow the recipe's directions step by step. So after roasting, the next step would be to prepare the meal, which might involve eating it. But the user needs to use the "eat" command with the roasted cheese. However, the user hasn't eaten anything yet. So the correct next action would be to eat the roasted cheese. But the user has to make sure that the cheese is actually roasted. Since the oven was closed, maybe the game considers that as roasting. Therefore, the next step is to eat the block of cheese.
