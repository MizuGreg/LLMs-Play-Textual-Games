You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A typical kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.

You can make out an opened fridge nearby. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a white onion and a red onion. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can see a counter. On the counter you can make out a green apple, a green bell pepper, a red apple, a tomato, a cookbook and a knife. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe to slice the green apple. They have the green apple and the knife. The problem is that the previous attempt to "use knife on green apple" didn't work. The system said that's not a recognized verb. So maybe the correct action is to use the knife on the apple, but the command needs to be phrased differently.

Wait, in the game, maybe the correct syntax is "slice the green apple with the knife" or "use the knife to slice the green apple". But the user tried "use knife on green apple" which might not be the right phrasing. The game might expect "slice" as the main verb here. But the user already tried "slice the green apple" and the system asked for the tool. So maybe the next step is to use the knife to slice it. But the system didn't accept "use knife on green apple". Maybe the correct action is "slice the green apple with the knife". Let me check the previous steps.

The user had the green apple and the knife. The recipe says to slice the green apple. The user tried "slice the green apple" but the system responded with a question about the tool. Then they tried "use knife on green apple" which didn't work. So perhaps the correct command is "slice the green apple with the knife". But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe "cut the green apple with the knife". But the recipe says "slice", so maybe the correct action is to use the knife to slice it. However, the system might require the exact command. Since the user is stuck, maybe the next action is to try "slice the green apple with the knife".

Okay, the user has the green apple and the knife now. The next step is to slice the apple. The previous attempt to use the knife didn't work, but now that the knife is taken, maybe the correct command is to slice the apple with the knife. The recipe says "slice the green apple", so maybe the action is "slice the green apple with the knife". But the game might require the exact phrasing. Alternatively, maybe "cut the green apple with the knife". However, the recipe specifies "slice", so I'll go with that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe. They have the green apple sliced. The next step is to roast it. But the game isn't accepting "roast the green apple" as a command. Maybe the correct verb is "bake" instead of "roast"? Or perhaps they need to use the oven. Wait, the recipe says "roast the green apple", but in the kitchen, there's an oven. Maybe the action is "put the sliced green apple in the oven" or "roast the green apple in the oven". But the user tried "roast the green apple" and it didn't work. Maybe the game expects "bake" instead. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the stove. But the stove isn't supposed to have anything on it. Hmm. The user has the knife and the apple. Maybe the correct action is to roast it using the oven. So the next step would be to roast the apple in the oven. But the game might require the exact command. Let me check the previous steps. The user sliced the apple, then tried to roast it. The system said "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe "roast" isn't the right verb here. Maybe "bake" is the correct verb. So the next action should be "bake the green apple". Alternatively, maybe "put the green apple in the oven" or "roast the green apple in the oven". But the user needs to use the correct command. Since the recipe says "roast", but the game doesn't recognize it, perhaps the correct action is to use the oven. So the next step is to roast the apple in the oven. But how to phrase that. Maybe "roast the green apple in the oven". But the game might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe "put the green apple in the oven" and then "roast it". But the user is stuck. The correct answer here is probably "roast the green apple", but the game says it's not a recognized verb. Maybe the user needs to use the oven. So the next action is to roast the apple in the oven. But the command needs to be correct. Maybe "roast the green apple with the oven". But that's not right. Alternatively, "use the oven to roast the green apple". But the game might not accept that. The user has to try "roast the green apple" again, but the system says it's not a verb. Maybe the correct action is "bake the green apple". Let me try that.

Okay, the user has put the green apple in the oven. The next step according to the recipe is to "roast the green apple". But the game might require a different command. Since the oven is open and the apple is inside, maybe the next action is to close the oven. Alternatively, the game might automatically consider the apple as roasted once it's in the oven. But the user needs to follow the recipe steps. The recipe says "roast the green apple", so maybe the correct action is "roast the green apple". But the system might not recognize that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "wait" for it to roast, but that's not a command. The user has already completed the steps: sliced and put in oven. Maybe the next step is to take the apple out after roasting. But the game might require the exact command. Let me check the previous steps. The user put the apple in the oven. The next step is to roast it. Since the game didn't accept "roast", maybe the correct action is to "close the oven" to simulate roasting.

Okay, the user is trying to "prepare meal" but the game says they're missing something. The recipe says to "prepare meal" after slicing and roasting. But the user has already put the apple in the oven and closed it. Maybe the next step is to take the roasted apple out of the oven and serve it. The command might be "take the green apple from the oven" or "serve the green apple". But the game didn't accept "take" earlier. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is "serve the meal" or "eat the green apple". But the recipe says "prepare meal", so maybe the user needs to "prepare the meal" with the roasted apple. Let me try "prepare the meal".

Okay, the user is stuck again. They have the roasted green apple in the oven, but can't figure out the final step. The recipe says "prepare meal", but the game isn't recognizing the commands. Maybe the correct action is to "eat the green apple" or "consume the meal". But the game might require a different phrasing. Alternatively, since the user has followed all the steps except the final one, maybe the game considers the meal prepared once the apple is roasted. But the user needs to complete the recipe. The last step in the recipe is "prepare meal", so maybe the correct command is "prepare meal" again. But the system said it's not understood. Maybe the user needs to "serve the meal" or "finish the meal". Let me try "finish the meal".

Okay, the user is really stuck here. They've followed all the steps: took the green apple, sliced it, roasted it in the oven. The recipe says "prepare meal", but the game isn't recognizing any of the commands. Maybe the correct action is to "eat the green apple" or "consume the meal". But the game says those aren't verbs. Wait, maybe the game expects the user to just "finish" the meal. But "finish" isn't a verb here. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "serve the meal" or "present the meal". But the system says those aren't recognized. The user has to try something else. Maybe the correct command is "eat the green apple" even though it's not a verb. Or perhaps the game is expecting the user to just "end" the meal. But I'm not sure. The user needs to guess the correct command. Let me try "eat the green apple".

Okay, the user is trying to eat the green apple but the game says they're confusing it with the bell pepper. Maybe the correct action is to "eat the green apple" again, but the game is picky. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "consume the green apple" or "take the green apple". But the game says "eat" isn't recognized. Wait, the user has the green apple in the oven. Maybe they need to "take the green apple from the oven" first. But earlier attempts didn't work. Alternatively, the game might require the user to "serve the green apple" or "present the meal". But the system says those aren't verbs. The user is stuck. The correct step is probably to "eat the green apple" even if it's not recognized. Or maybe the game expects "finish the meal" again.

Okay, the user is really stuck here. They've tried multiple commands, but the game keeps confusing them with the green bell pepper. The recipe requires preparing a meal with the green apple, but the game isn't recognizing the correct actions. Maybe the user needs to try a different approach. Since the green apple is in the oven, perhaps the correct step is to "take the green apple from the oven" or "get the green apple". But the game hasn't accepted those commands before. Alternatively, maybe the game expects the user to "serve the meal" or "finish the meal". However, the system says those aren't verbs. The user has to keep trying different commands until they get it right. The next step might be to "take the green apple from the oven" even though it's not working. Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting "eat the green apple" again. But the user has already tried that. Maybe the answer is to "serve the green apple" or "present the meal". But the system says those aren't recognized. The user is stuck, but they need to keep trying. The correct command is probably "eat the green apple" even if it's not recognized. Or maybe the game is expecting "finish the meal". But "finish" isn't a verb. The user has to guess the correct command.
