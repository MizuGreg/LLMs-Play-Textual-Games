You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You've entered a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop and a lettuce! You can make out a closed conventional looking oven close by. You can see a table. You see a knife on the table. You can see a counter. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in this text adventure. They started by looking at the cookbook, but it wasn't openable. Then they looked around, but couldn't find anything else. The cookbook's recipe only lists a pork chop, and the user is hesitant to eat the raw pork chop or the lettuce.

The goal is to cook a delicious meal. The recipe says to dice the pork chop, roast it, and prepare the meal. But the user is hesitant because the pork chop is raw. Maybe they need to find a way to cook it. The stove is in the kitchen, but it's empty. Wait, the user has a knife on the table. Maybe they can use the knife to dice the pork chop first. Then, since the stove is there, they might need to use it to roast the pork chop. But the stove is empty, so maybe they need to put the diced pork chop on it. But the user hasn't tried using the knife yet. The previous actions were looking at the cookbook, pork chop, and lettuce. The next logical step would be to take the knife and dice the pork chop. Then, maybe put it on the stove to roast. But the user is hesitant, so maybe they need to confirm if they have the right tools. The knife is on the table, so they can take it. Then dice the pork chop. Then use the stove. So the next action should be to take the knife.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They have a raw pork chop and a knife. The recipe says to dice the pork chop and then roast it. The user has already tried using the knife on the pork chop but got an error. The previous attempts were using "use knife on pork chop" which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "dice pork chop" but that requires the knife. Since the user has the knife, maybe they need to use the knife to dice the pork chop. The system message says to only output the action. The last attempt was "use knife on pork chop" which wasn't recognized. Maybe the correct command is "cut pork chop with knife" or similar. But the game might expect a specific phrase. Since the user is stuck, the next step is to try using the knife to dice the pork chop properly. The correct command might be "dice pork chop" but with the knife in hand. Alternatively, "cut pork chop with knife". But the game might have a specific verb. Since the user has the knife, maybe "cut pork chop" is sufficient. Let's try that.

Okay, the user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They have a raw pork chop and a knife. The recipe says to dice the pork chop and roast it. The user has tried several commands like "use knife on pork chop" and "dice pork chop", but got errors. The game's help command lists available actions, but the user is stuck.

The user needs to dice the pork chop using the knife. The previous attempts didn't work because the command format might be incorrect. The correct command should be "cut pork chop with knife" or "dice pork chop with knife". But since the game says "Cutting something requires a knife," maybe the user just needs to use "cut pork chop" since the knife is already in hand. Alternatively, the user might need to use the knife to cut the pork chop. The correct command is probably "cut pork chop with knife". But the game might expect a different phrasing.

Okay, the user is trying to cut the pork chop with the knife. The previous attempts to use "cut pork chop with knife" were met with confusion, but the game now responds with "What a good idea." So maybe the command is accepted. The next step is to roast the pork chop. The recipe says to roast it after dicing. The user has the knife and the pork chop. Now they need to use the stove to roast it. The stove is in the kitchen. So the next action should be to put the diced pork chop on the stove. The command would be "put diced pork chop on stove". But the user might need to first ensure the pork chop is diced. Since the game said "What a good idea," maybe the cutting is done. Now roast it. The correct command is "roast pork chop". Let's try that.

Okay, the user is trying to prepare the meal but got an error. The previous steps were cutting and roasting the pork chop. The recipe says to "prepare meal" after roasting. Maybe the correct command is "serve meal" or "eat meal". But the user needs to follow the recipe's directions. The recipe's directions are "dice the pork chop, roast the pork chop, prepare meal". So after roasting, the next step is preparing the meal. The user might need to use the stove or another appliance. Since the stove is in the kitchen and it's conventional, maybe "put pork chop on stove" or "cook meal". But the user already roasted it. Maybe "serve meal" is the correct command. Let's try that.

Okay, the user is stuck again. They tried "serve meal" but it didn't work. The recipe says to "prepare meal" after roasting. Maybe the correct command is "prepare meal" even though it's not a verb. Or perhaps the game expects a different action. Since the user has the roasted pork chop, maybe they need to eat it. The command "eat pork chop" might work. Let's try that.

Okay, the user is stuck again. They've tried multiple commands like "roast pork chop" and "use knife on pork chop", but the game keeps saying "That's not a verb I recognise." The previous steps showed that the user took the pork chop from the fridge, put it on the stove, and now they need to roast it. The problem is that the game doesn't recognize "roast" as a verb here. Maybe the correct command is "cook pork chop" or "burn pork chop" since the stove is conventional. Alternatively, since the user has the knife, maybe they need to use it to cut the pork chop again. But the recipe already said to dice it. Wait, the user might need to use the stove's function. The stove is there, so perhaps "put pork chop on stove" is the next step, but they already did that. Maybe the game expects a different action. Since the user is close, maybe the next step is to "serve meal" even though it's not a verb. Alternatively, the game might accept "eat pork chop" even though the user needs to cook it first. But the user already put it on the stove. Maybe the correct command is "cook pork chop" without the verb. Let's try "cook pork chop".
