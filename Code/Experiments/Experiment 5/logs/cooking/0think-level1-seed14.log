You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a green hot pepper, an orange bell pepper and a raw red tuna. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an oven. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience! You can make out a counter. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.
