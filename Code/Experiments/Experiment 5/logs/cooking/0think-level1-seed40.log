You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An usual one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a red hot pepper and a white onion. Hey, want to see an oven? Look over there, an oven. You see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. The table is massive. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove! The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?
