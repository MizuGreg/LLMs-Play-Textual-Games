You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

Well, here we are in a kitchen.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out a closed conventional looking oven in the room. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can see a counter. On the counter you can make out a green hot pepper, a green bell pepper, a red bell pepper, a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a yellow apple and a knife. You make out a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe says to chop the green hot pepper, fry it, and then prepare the meal. So far, they've taken the cookbook and tried to open it, but it wasn't possible. Then they looked at the cookbook and found the recipe. Now, they've tried to chop the green hot pepper, but the game response says they need a knife.

Wait, the user has a knife on the counter. The ingredients listed include a knife. So the next step is to use the knife to chop the pepper. But the user just tried to chop it without the knife, which wasn't possible. So the correct action would be to take the knife first, then use it to chop the pepper.

But the user's last action was "chop green hot pepper", which failed because they didn't have the knife. So the next step is to take the knife from the counter. Then, after taking the knife, they can chop the pepper. Once chopped, they need to fry it. Then follow the directions to prepare the meal. So the immediate next action should be to take the knife.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to chop the green hot pepper, but they need to use the knife. The previous attempt was "chop green hot pepper", which failed because they didn't have the knife. Then they took the knife, but the game didn't recognize "use knife on green hot pepper" as a valid command.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is to chop the pepper with the knife. Since the knife is already taken, the next step is to chop the pepper. The game might expect the command "chop green hot pepper" again, but since the knife is in hand, it should work now. Alternatively, maybe the command is "cut green hot pepper with knife". But the game's previous response said "Cutting something requires a knife," so perhaps the user needs to use the knife first. Wait, the user already took the knife. So maybe the correct command is just "chop green hot pepper" again, as the knife is now available. The game might have a limit on actions, so trying again might work. Let me check the previous steps. The user took the knife, so the next action should be to chop the pepper with the knife. The valid command might be "chop green hot pepper" since the knife is in hand. The game might not accept "use knife on" because it's not the right phrasing. So the next action is "chop green hot pepper".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to chop the green hot pepper, but the game says they need to take the pepper first. Wait, they already have the green hot pepper in their inventory, right? Because earlier they tried to chop it but couldn't because they didn't have the knife. Then they took the knife, but the game is now saying they need to take the pepper first. Maybe the pepper isn't in their inventory yet. Let me check the previous steps.

The user took the cookbook, then the knife. The green hot pepper was on the counter. Wait, maybe they didn't pick up the pepper yet. The recipe says to chop the green hot pepper, but if the user hasn't taken the pepper from the counter, they can't chop it. So the next step is to take the green hot pepper first. Then, with the knife, they can chop it. The game's last message said "You need to take the green hot pepper first," so the correct action is to take the green hot pepper from the counter.

The recipe says "fry the green hot pepper", so maybe the answer is "fry". But the game is asking for the tool, like "stove" or "pan". The user has a stove in the kitchen. So the correct command would be to use the stove to fry the pepper. But the game might expect the verb "fry" with the stove. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to say "fry green hot pepper with stove". But the game's previous response was asking for the tool. So the next action is to use the stove to fry the pepper. The command should be "fry green hot pepper with stove" or "use stove to fry green hot pepper". Let me check the possible commands. The user has the stove in the room. So the correct action is to use the stove to fry the pepper. The game might accept "fry green hot pepper with stove" or "use stove to fry green hot pepper". But the user needs to input the command.

Okay, the user is trying to fry the green hot pepper with the stove, but the game says "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the stove isn't in the current view. The user needs to look for the stove. The previous steps mentioned a stove in the room. So the correct action is to "look at stove" to confirm its presence. Then, after confirming, proceed to fry the pepper. But the game might require the user to interact with the stove first. So the next step is to look at the stove to see if it's there. Then, use it to fry the pepper. The command should be "look at stove" to check if it's available.

Okay, the user looked at the stove, and it's useful for frying. Now, the next step is to use the stove to fry the green hot pepper. The previous attempt to fry it with the stove failed because the game couldn't see the stove. But after looking at it, the stove is confirmed. So the correct command is to fry the green hot pepper using the stove. The game might expect the command "fry green hot pepper with stove" or "use stove to fry green hot pepper". Since the user has the knife and the pepper, the next action is to fry the pepper on the stove. The command should be "fry green hot pepper with stove".

Okay, the user is trying to fry the green hot pepper with the stove, but the game says "That's not a verb I recognise." So the command "fry" isn't working. Maybe the correct verb is "cook" instead of "fry". Or perhaps the user needs to use the stove first. The stove is in the kitchen, so maybe the command is "use stove to cook green hot pepper". Alternatively, the game might expect "heat" or "sear". Let me think. The recipe says "fry the green hot pepper", so the correct action is to fry it. But the game isn't recognizing "fry". Maybe the user needs to use the stove as the tool. So the command could be "cook green hot pepper on stove". But the game might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "heat" the pepper. Let me try "cook green hot pepper" without mentioning the stove. The game might have a different verb. Alternatively, the user might need to "sear" the pepper. But the recipe says "fry". Hmm. The correct action is to fry, but the game isn't recognizing it. Maybe the user needs to use the stove first. So the command is "use stove" then "fry". But the game is expecting a single command. Let me try "cook green hot pepper".
