You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've fallen into an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the kitchen.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot and a lettuce. You see a closed oven here. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. On the counter you can make out a tomato and a raw red potato. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.
