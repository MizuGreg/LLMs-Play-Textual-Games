You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a white onion, a raw white tuna and a yellow onion. A closed oven is right there by you. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a green apple, a cookbook and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

look
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a white onion, a raw white tuna and a yellow onion. A closed oven is right there by you. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a green apple, a cookbook and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.
