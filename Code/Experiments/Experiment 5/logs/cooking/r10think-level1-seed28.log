You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

You make out a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You can see an oven. You can see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. You see a yellow apple, a raw yellow potato, a green apple and a cookbook on the counter. You can see a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal using the cookbook in the kitchen. The recipe requires dicing a yellow apple. They have a knife on the table. The previous attempt to "dice the yellow apple" failed because the game didn't recognize "dice" as a verb. Then they tried "use knife on yellow apple", which also didn't work.

So, the problem is that the game expects a specific command format. The recipe says "dice the yellow apple", but maybe the correct command is to use the knife on the apple. However, the user tried "use knife on yellow apple" and got an error. Maybe the correct verb is "cut" instead of "dice"? Or perhaps the game expects a different structure, like "cut the apple with the knife".

Alternatively, maybe the game requires the user to first pick up the knife, then use it on the apple. But the user hasn't picked up the knife yet. Wait, the knife is on the table. So the steps would be: take the knife, then use it on the apple. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. The previous action was "use knife on yellow apple", which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "take knife" first, then "cut yellow apple with knife".

But the user is confused because the game isn't recognizing the commands. The recipe says "dice the yellow apple", but the game might require a different verb. Alternatively, maybe the game expects the user to use the knife to cut the apple, so the correct command is "cut yellow apple with knife".

Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting the user to use the knife on the apple, but the correct syntax is "use knife on yellow apple", but that didn't work. Wait, the user tried "use knife on yellow apple" and got "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe "use" isn't the right verb here. Maybe the correct verb is "cut" or "dice".

Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting the user to first take the knife, then cut the apple. So the next step should be "take knife", then "cut yellow apple".

But the user is at the step where they have the cookbook open, and the recipe says to dice the apple. The user tried "dice the yellow apple" which didn't work. Then they tried "use knife on yellow apple" which also didn't work. So the correct action might be to take the knife first, then use it to cut the apple. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the next step should be "take knife", then "cut yellow apple with knife".

But the user is asking if they're close to the goal. The current state is that they have the cookbook open, and the recipe is in front of them. The next logical step is to take the knife, then use it to cut the apple. Since the user hasn't taken the knife yet, the next action should be "take knife".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to "dice the yellow apple" and then "roast the yellow apple". But the user has a knife, so they need to use it to dice the apple.

Earlier attempts to use the knife on the apple resulted in "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is to use the knife on the apple, but the system is not accepting it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first cut the apple with the knife, then roast it.

Wait, the user tried "use knife on yellow apple" multiple times, but it's not working. Maybe the correct verb is "cut" instead of "use". But the recipe says "dice", which is a specific action. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "cut the yellow apple" with the knife. But the system might expect a different phrasing.

Alternatively, maybe after taking the knife, the user should "cut the yellow apple" instead of using the knife on it. But the game's response to "use knife on yellow apple" is an error. So perhaps the correct action is to "cut the yellow apple" without specifying the knife, assuming the knife is available. But the user has the knife, so maybe the correct command is "cut yellow apple with knife". However, the game might not accept that.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first "cut the yellow apple" and then "roast it". But the user is stuck on the first step. Since the game is not accepting "use knife on yellow apple", maybe the correct action is to "cut the yellow apple" directly. Let's try that.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is trying to follow a recipe from the cookbook in the kitchen. The recipe says to "dice the yellow apple," but they're having trouble doing that. They have a knife, so maybe they need to use it to dice the apple.

Wait, the user tried "use knife on yellow apple" multiple times, but the game keeps saying that's not a verb. Maybe the correct command is different. Let me check the previous interactions. 

Earlier, when the user tried "dice the yellow apple," the game responded that cutting requires a knife. Then the user tried "use knife on yellow apple," which isn't working. Maybe the correct verb is "cut" instead of "dice"? Or perhaps the game expects a specific command like "dice" with the knife. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first "take" the apple, then use the knife on it. But the apple is already in the counter. Wait, the user has the knife now. So the steps would be: take the apple, then use the knife to dice it. But the user hasn't taken the apple yet. 

Wait, the user is holding the yellow apple? Or is it on the counter? Let me check the game state. The user took the knife from the table, and the apple is on the counter. So maybe they need to take the apple first. But the user hasn't done that yet. 

So the correct sequence might be: take yellow apple, then use knife on it. But the user tried "use knife on yellow apple" without taking the apple. Maybe the game requires the apple to be in hand. So the next step should be to take the apple, then use the knife to dice it. 

But the user is stuck because they keep getting "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is "cut" instead of "dice"? Or maybe "slice"? The recipe says "dice," but the game might require a different verb. 

Alternatively, maybe the game expects the user to use the knife on the apple directly. But the user tried that and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "dice" with the knife. But the game says "That's not a verb I recognise." 

Hmm, this is confusing. The user has the knife, the apple is on the counter. They need to dice the apple. The correct action might be "cut yellow apple with knife," but the game might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe "dice the yellow apple" is the correct command, but the game requires the knife to be used. 

Wait, the user tried "dice the yellow apple" and the game said "Cutting something requires a knife." So the user needs to use the knife. But when they tried "use knife on yellow apple," it's not working. Maybe the correct command is "cut" instead of "dice"? Let me check the recipe again. The recipe says "dice the yellow apple," so maybe the game expects "dice" as the verb. But the user is getting an error. 

Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting the user to use the knife to cut the apple, so the command should be "cut yellow apple with knife." But the game might not accept that. 

This is tricky. The user is stuck because they can't get the correct command. The previous attempt was "use knife on yellow apple," which isn't working. Maybe the correct command is "cut" instead of "dice"? Let me try that. The user could try "cut yellow apple." But the game might require the knife. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first take the apple. So the steps are: take yellow apple, then use knife on it. But the user hasn't taken the apple yet. 

So the next action should be to take the apple. Then, use the knife to dice it. But the user is getting errors. Maybe the correct command is "take yellow apple," then "dice it" with the knife. 

But the user is at the point where they have the knife and the apple is on the counter. So the next step is to take the apple, then use the knife to dice it. But the user hasn't taken the apple yet. 

So the correct next action is "take yellow apple." Then, "dice" it. But the user is getting errors. Maybe the game is expecting the user to use the knife on the apple after taking it. 

So the answer is to take the apple first, then use the knife to dice it. But the user is stuck on the "use knife on yellow apple" command. Maybe the correct command is "cut" instead of "dice." 

Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting the user to use the knife to cut the apple, so the command is "cut yellow apple with knife." But the game might not accept that. 

In the end, the user needs to take the apple, then use the knife to dice it. So the next action is "take yellow apple."

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to dice the yellow apple, roast it, and prepare the meal. So far, they've managed to dice the apple, which gave them a point. Now they're stuck on the "roast" part.

The error messages say "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe "roast" isn't a valid command here. Maybe the game expects a different verb or a specific action. Let me check the previous steps. The user tried "roast yellow apple" multiple times, but it's not working. 

Wait, maybe the correct verb is "roast" but they need to use it in a different way. Or perhaps the game uses "roast" as part of a different command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to place the apple in the oven. The kitchen has an oven mentioned. So maybe the next step is to put the roasted apple into the oven?

But the recipe says "roast the yellow apple," so maybe the action is to roast it. However, the game might not recognize "roast" as a verb. Maybe the correct action is "put in oven" or "place in oven." Alternatively, maybe "roast" is a valid verb, but the user needs to use it correctly. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the oven. So after dicing the apple, they need to put it in the oven to roast it. So the next step would be to take the diced apple and put it in the oven. Let me check the objects in the kitchen. The user has the knife and the yellow apple. The oven is in the kitchen. So the correct action might be to put the apple in the oven. 

But the recipe says "roast the yellow apple," so maybe the correct action is to roast it, but the game's verbs might be different. Alternatively, maybe "roast" is a valid verb, but the user is using it incorrectly. Let me think. The user tried "roast yellow apple" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "roast the yellow apple" with "the" included. But the game might not accept that. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the oven. So the steps would be: take the diced apple, put it in the oven, then roast it. But the game might have specific commands for that. Since the user is stuck on "roast," maybe the correct action is to use the oven. So the next step is to put the apple in the oven. Let me check the available actions. The user can see an oven. So the correct action might be to put the apple in the oven. 

Therefore, the next command should be "put yellow apple in oven" or similar. But the user has to use the exact command the game recognizes. Since the user tried "roast" and it didn't work, maybe the correct action is to use the oven. So the next step is to put the apple in the oven.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe says to dice the yellow apple, roast it, and prepare the meal. So far, the user has managed to dice the apple using the knife, which gave them a score increase. Then they tried to roast the apple but kept getting errors because "roast" wasn't recognized as a verb. 

Wait, maybe the correct command is "roast the yellow apple" instead of just "roast". But the system kept saying "That's not a verb I recognise." Hmm. Then the user tried to put the apple in the oven, which worked after opening it. They closed the oven and tried to wait for 30 minutes, but the system didn't understand "wait 30 minutes" and kept prompting again.

So, maybe the next step is to check if the apple is cooked. Since the user put it in the oven and closed it, maybe they need to open it again to take out the roasted apple. Alternatively, maybe the game expects a specific command like "take yellow apple from oven" or "open oven again". But the user already tried opening the oven once. Wait, the last action was closing the oven, so maybe they need to open it again to retrieve the apple. But the user might not have realized that. Alternatively, maybe the oven is closed, and they need to open it to get the apple out. But the user tried that already. 

Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting the user to "prepare meal" after roasting, but the user hasn't done that yet. However, the recipe says "prepare meal" as the last step. So perhaps after roasting, they need to do something else. But the user hasn't completed the steps yet. The user is stuck on the "roast" command, which isn't working. Maybe the correct verb is "roast" followed by the object, like "roast yellow apple", but the system isn't recognizing it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the oven's function, like "use oven on yellow apple" or something similar. But the user tried putting it in the oven, which worked. 

Wait, the user put the apple in the oven, closed it, and tried to wait. But the game might not have a "wait" command. Maybe the correct action is to take the apple out of the oven once it's done. But the user hasn't done that yet. So maybe the next step is to open the oven again, take the apple out, and then prepare the meal. But the user might not have realized that the oven needs to be opened again. Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting the user to "serve meal" or "eat meal" once everything is done. 

But the user is at a loss because the "roast" command isn't working. So the next action should be to open the oven again to take the apple out, then maybe prepare the meal. But the user might not know that. Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting the user to "cook" the apple, but that's not in the recipe. The recipe says "roast the yellow apple" and "prepare meal". So after roasting, the user needs to prepare the meal, which might involve taking the apple out of the oven and serving it. 

But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to open the oven again, take the apple out, and then prepare the meal. However, the user might not have the correct commands for that. So the assistant should suggest opening the oven again to retrieve the apple, then maybe "prepare meal" or something similar.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe says to dice the yellow apple, roast it, and prepare the meal. So far, they've managed to dice the apple and roast it by putting it in the oven. But now they're stuck at the "prepare meal" step.

The problem is that after taking the apple out of the oven, the game says "Something still needs to be cooked." So maybe the recipe requires more steps. Let me check the original recipe again. The directions are: dice the yellow apple, roast the yellow apple, prepare meal. Wait, maybe "prepare meal" is the final step, but the game is expecting another action. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to combine the roasted apple with something else, but the recipe only lists the apple as an ingredient. 

The user has the knife and the apple. They tried using the knife on the apple again, but that didn't work. Maybe they need to use the apple in another way. Since the recipe only mentions the apple, perhaps "prepare meal" is the correct action, but the game is not recognizing it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to eat the apple, but that's not cooking. 

Wait, the original goal was to cook a delicious meal. The user has roasted the apple, so maybe "prepare meal" is the final step. But the game says something still needs to be cooked. Maybe the user needs to cook another ingredient, but the recipe only has the apple. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to combine the roasted apple with something else, but there's no other ingredient mentioned. 

The user has the cookbook, which was opened, and the recipe is clear. The steps are done: dice and roast. The last step is prepare meal. But the game is prompting for another action. Maybe the user needs to eat the meal, but that's not cooking. Or maybe the game expects the user to use the apple in a different way. Since the user has the roasted apple, maybe they need to put it on the table or somewhere, but the game doesn't recognize that as a valid action. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the oven again, but the oven is already closed. The user tried opening it again, but that's already been done. The user is stuck at the "prepare meal" step, and the game is not accepting it. So the next action might be to eat the apple, but that's not cooking. Or maybe the user needs to use the apple in another recipe, but the cookbook only has this one. 

Wait, the user has the knife and the apple. Maybe they need to slice it again, but that's already been done. The game is not recognizing "prepare meal" as a valid action. So perhaps the correct action is to eat the apple, but the game might not allow that. Alternatively, the user might need to use the apple in another way. But according to the recipe, that's the only step. 

I think the user is close, but the game is not accepting the final step. Maybe the correct action is to eat the meal, but the game doesn't have that command. Alternatively, the user needs to use the apple in the stove, but the stove is empty. The user has already roasted the apple in the oven. Maybe the game is expecting the user to use the apple in the stove, but that's not part of the recipe. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to combine the apple with another ingredient, but the recipe only has the apple. The user has the yellow apple, but the recipe says to use the yellow apple. So perhaps the meal is ready, and the user needs to eat it. But the game might not have that command. 

In this case, the user's last action was "prepare meal", which the game didn't recognize. The next step might be to eat the apple, but the game might not allow that. Alternatively, the user needs to use the apple in the stove, but that's not part of the recipe. 

Given the instructions, the user should try "eat yellow apple" or "consume meal", but the game might not recognize those. Alternatively, the user might need to use the apple in the oven again, but that's already been done. 

I think the correct action here is to eat the apple, even if the game doesn't recognize it. But since the user is supposed to only output the command, maybe "eat yellow apple" is the next step. However, the game might not have that command. Alternatively, the user might need to use the apple in the stove, but that's not part of the recipe. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the apple in the oven again, but that's already been done. The user is stuck, so the next action might be to eat the apple, even if the game doesn't recognize it. But according to the game's previous responses, "prepare meal" wasn't recognized. So maybe the user needs to try "eat yellow apple" as the next action.
