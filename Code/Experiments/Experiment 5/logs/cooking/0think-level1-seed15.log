You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An usual one.

You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a fridge. Hmmm... what else, what else? The fridge contains a raw white tuna, a white onion, a raw red tuna, a yellow onion and a block of cheese. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You make out an oven! You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh, great. Here's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.
