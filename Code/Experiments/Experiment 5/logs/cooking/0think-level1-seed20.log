You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a red onion and a lettuce. A closed oven is in the room. You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you make out a knife. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato, a yellow apple and a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.
