-= Kitchen =-
You've just shown up in a kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see an opened fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You can make out a closed oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. You see a cookbook on the table. Huh, weird. You can see a counter. You see a raw red potato, a red bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.
