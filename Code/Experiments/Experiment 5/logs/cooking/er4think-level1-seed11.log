You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a red hot pepper, a carrot, a lettuce and a block of cheese. You wonder idly who left that here. You make out a closed oven right there by you. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user is in a kitchen game where they need to cook a meal. They found the cookbook on the counter, so maybe they need to check the recipe. But earlier, when they tried to open the cookbook, it wasn't possible. Wait, maybe they need to look at the cookbook again to see if there's a way to open it. Alternatively, maybe they need to find ingredients from the fridge and oven. The fridge has some vegetables and cheese, and the oven is closed. The stove is empty. So maybe the next step is to check the recipe in the cookbook to see what's needed. But since they took the cookbook, maybe they need to read it. But the game might require interacting with the cookbook in a specific way. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user took the cookbook from the counter. Now, maybe they need to open it. But earlier, when they tried to open it, it wasn't possible. Wait, maybe the cookbook is closed, so they need to open it first. But the user just took it, so perhaps the next action is to open the cookbook again. Alternatively, maybe they need to look at the ingredients in the fridge to see what's available. The goal is to cook a meal, so they need to find a recipe and ingredients. The cookbook might have a recipe, so they need to check it. But the user tried to open it and failed. Maybe the correct action is to look at the cookbook again, or maybe there's another step. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the knife to cut something, but the recipe might require specific steps. Let me think: the user has the cookbook, so the next logical step is to check the recipe inside. But since they couldn't open it before, maybe they need to try again. Or perhaps the cookbook is already open, and they need to read it. But the game might require a specific command. The previous attempt was "open cookbook", which didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to "look at cookbook" or "read cookbook". But the user's last action was taking the cookbook, so maybe the next step is to check its contents. Alternatively, maybe they need to find the ingredients from the fridge. Let me check the available items again. The fridge has orange bell pepper, red hot pepper, carrot, lettuce, cheese. The counter has a red apple, cookbook, knife. The oven is closed. The stove is empty. So maybe the user needs to use the ingredients from the fridge and the cookbook to make a recipe. The next step could be to check the recipe in the cookbook to see what's needed. But since the user couldn't open it before, maybe they need to try again. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is already open, and they need to look at it. But the game might require a specific command. The user's last action was taking the cookbook, so the next step is probably to open it. But earlier, that didn't work. Wait, maybe the user needs to look at the cookbook to find the recipe. So the next action should be "look at cookbook" or "read cookbook". But the game might have specific commands. Let me think: the user tried "open cookbook" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to "look at cookbook" to see the contents. So the next command should be "look at cookbook".

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to "dice the orange bell pepper" and "roast the orange bell pepper". But when they tried to use the knife on the orange bell pepper, it didn't work. The error message says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct command is to use the knife on the pepper to dice it.

Wait, the user previously tried "use knife on orange bell pepper" and got an error. Maybe the correct action is to "dice orange bell pepper" again, but the system says cutting requires a knife. So perhaps they need to use the knife first. Alternatively, maybe the command should be "cut orange bell pepper with knife" or something similar. But the game might expect a specific syntax. Since the user has the knife and the orange bell pepper, the next step is to use the knife on the pepper to dice it. The correct command might be "use knife on orange bell pepper" again, but the system says that's not a verb. Maybe the correct verb is "dice" instead of "cut". Let me check the previous steps. The user tried "dice orange bell pepper" and got an error. Then they tried "use knife on orange bell pepper" which also didn't work. The system says "Cutting something requires a knife." So maybe the correct command is to "cut orange bell pepper" but with the knife. Alternatively, the game might require the user to first use the knife on the pepper to cut it. But the user tried that and got an error. Maybe the correct action is to "cut orange bell pepper" again, even though it's not a verb. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "roast the orange bell pepper" after dicing it. But the recipe says to dice first. So the next step is to use the knife on the pepper to dice it. The correct command might be "use knife on orange bell pepper" again, even though the system says it's not a verb. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "cut" the pepper with the knife. But the system says "Cutting something requires a knife." So perhaps the correct command is "cut orange bell pepper" with the knife. But the user has to use the correct syntax. The previous attempt was "use knife on orange bell pepper" which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "cut orange bell pepper" without mentioning the knife, but the system says a knife is needed. So the user needs to use the knife first. Therefore, the next action should be "use knife on orange bell pepper" again, even though it's not a verb. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is "dice orange bell pepper" again. But the system says that's not possible. So the user is stuck here. The next step is to try using the knife on the pepper again, even though it's not a verb. The correct command might be "use knife on orange bell pepper".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cut the orange bell pepper. The previous attempt was "cut orange bell pepper", but the system responded that they need to specify how to cut it—slice, dice, or chop. The user is stuck because they have to choose one of those methods. The recipe says "dice the orange bell pepper", so maybe they should try "dice" again. But the system might require the exact command. The user has the knife, so using the knife with the correct verb is necessary. The correct action would be to use the knife to dice the pepper. So the next command should be "dice orange bell pepper with knife" or similar. But the game might expect "dice" as the verb. Let me check the previous steps. The user tried "dice orange bell pepper" and got an error. Then they tried "use knife on orange bell pepper" which also didn't work. Now the system says to specify slice, dice, or chop. So the correct command is to choose one of those. Since the recipe says "dice", the user should try "dice orange bell pepper" again. But the system might require the knife to be used. So the next action is "dice orange bell pepper".

Okay, the user is trying to dice the orange bell pepper but keeps getting errors. The game says cutting requires a knife, and previous attempts to use "dice" or "use knife" didn't work. Maybe the correct command is to use the knife on the pepper to slice it. The system might expect "slice" instead of "dice". Let me check the recipe again. The recipe says "dice the orange bell pepper", but maybe the game requires a different verb. The user has the knife, so using it to slice the pepper might be the way. The correct command could be "slice orange bell pepper with knife". But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to just slice it without specifying the knife. But the system says a knife is needed. So the next action is to try slicing the pepper with the knife.
