You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A typical one. You start to take note of what's in the room.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You make out a counter. You see a red apple, a raw red potato, a yellow apple, a raw yellow potato, a tomato and a cookbook on the counter. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a kitchen, and their goal is to cook a delicious meal. They checked the cookbook but couldn't find it. The fridge has cheese and an orange bell pepper. The table has a knife, and the counter has items like apples, potatoes, a tomato, and a cookbook. Wait, the user first looked at the cookbook on the counter, but the system said they couldn't see it. Then they checked again, but still no luck. Maybe the cookbook is hidden or not visible at first.

Hmm, the user is confused because they expected the cookbook to be there. The counter has the cookbook, but maybe they need to interact with it more. Maybe the cookbook is in a different location or requires a specific action to access. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look elsewhere. The kitchen has an oven, a stove, a fridge, a table, and a counter. The cookbook is on the counter, but the user might have missed it the first time. Let me check the description again.

The user first looked at the cookbook on the counter, but the system said they couldn't see it. Then they checked again, and the system said the same. Maybe the cookbook is not actually there? Wait, the initial description says: "You see a cookbook on the counter." So why can't the user see it? Maybe there's a misunderstanding. Perhaps the user needs to pick it up or open it. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is in a different part of the room. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the counter is part of the kitchen. Maybe the user needs to look more carefully. The next action should be to check the counter again, maybe look under something or check the items on the counter again. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife to cut something, but that's not relevant yet. The main goal is to find the cookbook. Since the system says the user can't see it, maybe the user needs to look at the counter again, perhaps in a different way. Maybe the user needs to look at the counter's contents again. The next action should be to look at the counter again, maybe to find the cookbook. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the table again. But the table has a knife. Wait, the initial description says the counter has the cookbook. So maybe the user needs to pick it up. The next action should be to take the cookbook from the counter. But the user hasn't done that yet. The user's previous actions were looking at the cookbook, but the system says they can't see it. Maybe the user needs to check the counter again, perhaps more thoroughly. So the next action should be to look at the counter again, maybe to find the cookbook.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal in the kitchen. They started by looking for the cookbook, but couldn't find it. Then they checked the counter again, still no luck. Next, they looked at the table, found a knife, and examined the knife. The knife is described as "well matched to everything else here," which might mean it's a good tool for cooking.

The user's goal is to find the cookbook to get the recipe. So far, they've checked the counter and the table but haven't found the cookbook. Maybe the cookbook is hidden somewhere else. The fridge has cheese and a bell pepper, but that's not helpful. The stove and oven are there, but no ingredients on them. The table has the knife, but no cookbook. The counter was mentioned as having the cookbook initially, but the user can't see it. Maybe the cookbook is in a different location or requires a specific action to access. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife to cut something, but that's not directly related to finding the cookbook.

Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the cookbook was mentioned on the counter. The system says the user can't see it, so maybe the user needs to look more carefully. Perhaps the cookbook is under something on the counter. The user hasn't checked the counter's contents again. The next step should be to look at the counter again, maybe more thoroughly. Alternatively, check the fridge again, but the fridge's contents are already listed. The user might need to check the oven or stove, but those are empty. The table has the knife, but no cookbook. The user is stuck because they can't find the cookbook. The next action should be to look at the counter again, perhaps to find the cookbook. The user might need to interact with the counter in a different way, like checking under items or opening a drawer, but the description doesn't mention that. So the best next step is to look at the counter again.

Maybe the cookbook is in a different location they haven't checked. The kitchen has an oven, stove, and counter. The user has looked at the counter, table, and fridge. Maybe they need to check the oven or stove? But the stove is empty. The oven is described as being left there, maybe it's not useful. Wait, the user hasn't checked the oven yet. Maybe the cookbook is inside the oven? That seems odd, but maybe. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is on the counter but hidden under something. The user has looked at the counter multiple times. Maybe they need to check the oven next. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look around the kitchen again. The next action should be to check the oven. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to look at the oven.

Okay, the user is trying to find the cookbook to cook a meal. They've checked the counter, table, fridge, and oven but haven't found it yet. The oven is described as useful for roasting, but that doesn't help with finding the cookbook. The user might be missing something. Let me think again. The initial description said the counter has the cookbook. Maybe the user needs to look at the counter again, but the system says they can't see it. Maybe the cookbook is in a different part of the kitchen. Wait, the stove is mentioned but has nothing on it. The fridge has cheese and a bell pepper. The table has a knife. The oven is there. Maybe the user needs to check the stove again. Or perhaps the cookbook is in the oven? That seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife to cut something, but that's not related. The user is stuck. The next action should be to look at the counter again, even though the system says they can't see it. Maybe there's a trick here. Alternatively, check the stove again. But the stove is empty. Maybe the user needs to check the oven again. But the oven is already checked. Hmm. The user needs to find the cookbook. Since the initial description said the counter has it, maybe the user needs to look at the counter again, perhaps in a different way. The next action is to look at the counter again.

Okay, the user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to "dice the red apple" and "roast the red apple". The user tried "dice the red apple" but got an error. Maybe the correct command is "cut the red apple" instead of "dice". Alternatively, the game might require using the knife to dice it. The user has the knife on the table. So the next step is to use the knife to dice the red apple. The correct command might be "cut the red apple with the knife" or just "cut the red apple". Since the game didn't accept "dice", maybe "cut" is the right verb here. So the next action should be to cut the red apple.

You need to specify how you want to cut the red apple. Either slice, dice, or chop it.

Okay, the user is having trouble with the game's response when trying to dice the red apple. The game keeps saying they need to specify slice, dice, or chop. The user has tried "dice" and "cut" but got errors. Maybe the correct command is "slice" instead of "dice"? Or perhaps the game expects the user to use the knife first. The user has the knife on the table. So the next step is to use the knife to dice the apple. The correct command might be "dice the red apple with the knife" or just "dice the red apple". Since the game didn't accept "dice", maybe "slice" is the right choice. Let's try "slice the red apple".

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, the user is really stuck here. They need to follow the recipe to dice the red apple, but the game isn't accepting their commands. The recipe says "dice the red apple", but the game keeps rejecting it. The user has the knife on the table. Maybe the correct command is "cut the red apple with the knife". The user tried "cut the red apple" but got an error. The game might need the knife specified. So the next action should be to cut the red apple using the knife.
