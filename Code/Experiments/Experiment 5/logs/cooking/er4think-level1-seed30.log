You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

You can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a carrot and an orange bell pepper. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. You see a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper, a raw red tuna, a yellow bell pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe says to slice the red hot pepper, fry it, and then prepare the meal. So far, they've taken the cookbook, opened it, and started reading. The first step was to slice the red hot pepper.

But when they tried to slice it, the game responded that cutting something requires a knife. Oh, right! The user has a knife on the counter. So the next logical step is to use the knife to slice the pepper. Wait, the user already has the knife, right? Let me check the inventory.

Looking back, the counter has a red hot pepper, raw red tuna, yellow bell pepper, cookbook, and a knife. So the knife is available. The user needs to use the knife to slice the pepper. The previous action was "slice red hot pepper", but the game said they need a knife. So the correct action now is to take the knife and then slice the pepper with it.

But the user might not have taken the knife yet. So first, they should take the knife from the counter. Then, use it to slice the pepper. But the game might require using the knife first. Alternatively, maybe the action is to use the knife on the pepper. Let me think about the possible commands. The user has to use the knife to slice the pepper. So the next step is to take the knife, then slice the pepper with it. But the game might allow "slice red hot pepper with knife" or similar. However, the previous attempt was just "slice red hot pepper", which failed. So the correct action is to take the knife first, then slice the pepper.

Wait, but the user is in the kitchen, and the knife is on the counter. So the user needs to take the knife. Then, use it to slice the pepper. So the next action should be "take knife from counter". Then, "slice red hot pepper with knife". But the game might require the knife to be in hand. So first, take the knife, then slice. But the user might not have taken the knife yet. So the next action is to take the knife. Then, proceed to slice. But the user's last action was "slice red hot pepper", which failed. So the next step is to take the knife first. Therefore, the correct next action is "take knife from counter".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to slice the red hot pepper, fry it, and then prepare the meal. So far, they've sliced the pepper. The next step is to fry it.

But the user tried "fry red hot pepper" and got an error saying it's not a recognized verb. Hmm. Maybe the correct command is to use the stove. Since the stove is in the kitchen, maybe they need to put the sliced pepper into the stove. Alternatively, maybe "fry" is a valid command, but the game expects a different phrasing. Wait, the stove is conventional, so perhaps the action is to put the pepper into the stove and then fry it. Or maybe the user needs to use the stove first. Let me check the environment again.

The kitchen has a stove. The user has the sliced red hot pepper. So the next step is to use the stove to fry the pepper. The correct command might be "put red hot pepper in stove" or "fry red hot pepper on stove". But the game might require a specific verb. Since "fry" wasn't working, maybe the correct action is to use the stove. So the next step is to use the stove to fry the pepper. Therefore, the command should be "fry red hot pepper on stove" or similar. But the game might accept "fry red hot pepper" if the stove is the current location. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go to the stove first. Wait, the user is currently in the kitchen, so maybe they can just fry it there. But the previous attempt failed. Maybe the correct action is "fry red hot pepper" again, but the game is expecting a different command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove. So the next action is to use the stove to fry the pepper. So the command would be "fry red hot pepper with stove" or "put red hot pepper in stove". But the game might require "fry" as a verb. Since the user tried "fry" and it didn't work, maybe the correct action is to use the stove. So the next step is to use the stove. Therefore, the command is "fry red hot pepper on stove".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to fry the red hot pepper. They've tried several variations of the command, but the game keeps saying it's not a recognized verb. The previous steps were taking the knife, slicing the pepper, and now trying to fry it.

The recipe says to "fry the red hot pepper" after slicing. But the game might require a specific command structure. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove. Since the stove is in the kitchen, perhaps the user needs to put the pepper into the stove. Alternatively, maybe the verb is "cook" instead of "fry". Or maybe the user needs to use the stove's function. Let me think about possible commands. The user is in the kitchen, and the stove is there. So maybe the correct command is "put red hot pepper in stove" or "cook red hot pepper on stove". But the game might expect "fry" as part of the command. Wait, the user tried "fry red hot pepper on stove" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct verb is "heat" or "cook". Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove's action. Since the stove is conventional, perhaps the action is to use the stove to fry. But the game is not recognizing "fry" as a verb here. Maybe the correct command is "use stove to fry red hot pepper". But the user has to follow the recipe's directions. The recipe says "fry the red hot pepper", so maybe the correct command is "fry red hot pepper". But the game says it's not a recognized verb. Maybe the user needs to use the stove first. So the correct action is to put the pepper into the stove and then fry it. But the game might require the exact command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove's function. Since the user is stuck, maybe the next step is to try "cook red hot pepper on stove" or "heat red hot pepper in stove". But the game might expect "fry" as the verb. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove's action. Since the user is in the kitchen, maybe the correct command is "fry red hot pepper". But the game is not accepting it. Maybe the user needs to use the stove's name. So the correct command is "fry red hot pepper with stove". But the game says that's not a verb. Hmm. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove to cook the pepper. So the command is "cook red hot pepper on stove". But the game might not recognize "cook" as a verb. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove's function. Since the user is stuck, maybe the next action is to try "put red hot pepper in stove" to start the frying process. That might be the correct command. So the next action is "put red hot pepper in stove".

Alternatively, since the user is stuck, maybe the next step is to "prepare meal" as per the recipe. But the recipe says after frying. Hmm. The user has sliced and put on the stove.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck again. They've tried multiple variations of "fry red hot pepper" but the game keeps saying it's not a recognized verb. Let me think about the possible commands again. The recipe says to "fry the red hot pepper" after slicing. The user has the pepper on the stove. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove's function. Since the stove is there, maybe the command is "use stove to fry red hot pepper". But the game might not recognize "use" as a verb here. Alternatively, maybe the correct verb is "cook". The user tried "cook" earlier but got an error. Wait, maybe the game expects the user to "heat" the pepper. Or perhaps the user needs to "put" the pepper into the stove and then "heat" it. But the user already put it on the stove. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "fry" without specifying the stove, but the game doesn't recognize it. Since the user is in the kitchen and the stove is there, maybe the correct action is to "fry" the pepper, and the game is just not recognizing it. Maybe the user needs to try "fry" again. But the game says it's not a verb. Hmm. Maybe the correct action is to "prepare meal" as per the recipe. But the recipe says after frying. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "cook" the pepper. Let me try "cook red hot pepper on stove".
