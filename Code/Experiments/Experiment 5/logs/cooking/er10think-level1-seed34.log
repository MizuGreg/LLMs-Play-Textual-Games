You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.

Oh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a green apple, a red bell pepper, a raw white tuna and a carrot. You can make out an oven. You can see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw purple potato and a red apple. You see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove appears to be empty. This always happens, here in TextWorld!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe to dice the green bell pepper. The problem is that the game's response says "Cutting something requires a knife," but the user is trying to use the knife on the pepper.

Wait, the user tried "use knife on green bell pepper" but the game says that's not a verb. Then they tried "use knife to dice green bell pepper," which also didn't work. The game is expecting a different command. Maybe the correct action is to "dice the green bell pepper" but with the knife. But the game might require a specific phrasing. 

Looking back, the initial recipe says "dice the green bell pepper" as part of the directions. But the user needs to use the knife to do that. The game might require the user to use the knife on the pepper to dice it. However, the previous attempts didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "cut green bell pepper with knife" or something similar. But the game's error messages suggest that "use knife on" isn't correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the game expects the user to first pick up the knife, then use it on the pepper. But the user hasn't picked up the knife yet. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the knife is on the table. So the user needs to pick up the knife first. But in the previous steps, the user hasn't done that. 

Wait, the user's last action was "use knife to dice green bell pepper," which the game didn't recognize. So perhaps the correct command is "cut green bell pepper with knife" or "dice green bell pepper with knife." But the game might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "use knife on green bell pepper" but the game is expecting a different verb. 

Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting the user to "dice the green bell pepper" without specifying the knife, but the game requires the knife to be used. Since the user has the knife on the table, they need to pick it up first. So the correct sequence is: take knife, then use it on the pepper. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. 

Wait, the initial description says the user sees a knife on the table. So the first step should be to take the knife. Then, use it on the pepper. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be "take knife" to pick it up. Then, use the knife on the pepper. But the user's previous attempts were trying to use the knife without taking it. 

So the correct next step is to take the knife first. Then, use it on the green bell pepper. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the next action should be "take knife". Then, after taking it, use it on the pepper. But the user is stuck because they can't use the knife without taking it. 

Therefore, the correct next action is to take the knife. Then, use it on the green bell pepper. But the user's last attempt was trying to use the knife without taking it. So the next step is to take the knife first.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe to cook a meal. The recipe says to dice the green bell pepper, fry it, and then prepare the meal. So far, they've managed to dice the pepper using the knife. Now they need to fry it.

The user tried "fry green bell pepper" but got an error. Maybe the correct command is "fry the green bell pepper" with the article "the". But the game might expect a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the stove since that's where frying usually happens. The previous steps showed that the stove is empty, so perhaps they need to put the diced pepper into the stove.

Wait, the recipe says "fry the green bell pepper". The user has the diced pepper. So the next step is to fry it. The game might require the command "fry the green bell pepper" even though it's not a verb. Alternatively, maybe "put the diced green bell pepper into the stove" or something like that. But the user has tried "fry" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove. Let me check the environment again.

The kitchen has a stove, which is empty. So maybe the user needs to place the diced pepper into the stove. The command could be "put green bell pepper in stove" or "put diced green bell pepper in stove". But the user hasn't picked up the diced pepper yet. Wait, in the previous step, they diced the pepper and it's now in their inventory. So the next step is to put it into the stove to fry it. The correct command might be "put green bell pepper in stove" or "fry green bell pepper on stove". But the game might not accept "fry" as a verb here. Alternatively, maybe "heat stove" first, then put the pepper in. But the recipe says to fry it, so perhaps the correct action is to use the stove to fry the pepper. Since the user has the diced pepper, the next step is to put it into the stove. So the command would be "put green bell pepper in stove" or similar. The user tried "fry" and it didn't work, so maybe that's the issue. The correct action is to place it in the stove to fry.

Okay, the user is trying to fry the green bell pepper. They've already diced it and put it on the stove. The problem is that the game isn't recognizing "fry" as a verb here. Maybe the correct action is to use the stove's functionality. Since the stove is empty, perhaps they need to heat it first. Alternatively, the game might expect a different command like "cook" or "heat". But the recipe says "fry", so maybe the user needs to use the stove to fry it. The previous attempts to use "fry" didn't work, so maybe the correct command is "heat stove" or "put in stove". But the user already put the pepper on the stove. Maybe the next step is to "cook" the pepper. Alternatively, the game might require the user to "use stove to fry". But the user can't use the stove directly. Wait, the user has the pepper on the stove. Maybe the correct action is to "cook green bell pepper" or "fry green bell pepper on stove". But the game isn't accepting "fry". Maybe the correct verb is "heat" or "cook". Let me check the previous steps. The user put the pepper on the stove, so maybe the next step is to "heat" it. But the recipe says "fry". Alternatively, maybe the game expects the user to "use stove to fry". But the user can't use the stove directly. Hmm. The user is stuck because the game doesn't recognize "fry". Maybe the correct action is to "cook" the green bell pepper. Let's try that.

Okay, the user is stuck trying to fry the green bell pepper. They've tried "fry" multiple times, but the game doesn't recognize it. The available commands list shows that "fry" isn't a valid verb here. The user has the pepper on the stove, so maybe the correct action is to use the stove's function. But the game might require a different command. Looking at the available commands, "put ... on ..." is there. Maybe the user needs to put the pepper in the stove. But they already put it on. Alternatively, maybe "heat" the stove first. But the user tried "heat stove" and it didn't work. The recipe says to fry, but the game might not accept that. The user is close, but needs the right command. Maybe "cook" is the correct verb here. Let's try "cook green bell pepper".

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck trying to fry the green bell pepper. They've tried "fry", "cook", and "use stove to cook", but all are rejected. The stove is empty, and the user has the pepper on it. Maybe the correct action is to "heat" the stove first. Alternatively, the game might expect a different verb. Since the recipe says "fry", maybe the user needs to use the stove's function. But the game isn't accepting "fry". Maybe the correct command is "heat stove" to prepare it for frying. Let's try that.
