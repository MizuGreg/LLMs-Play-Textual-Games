You've entered a kitchen.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. The fridge contains a red onion, a raw red potato, a white onion, a green bell pepper and an orange bell pepper. You check the price tag on the fridge. 80 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can make out a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook and a knife. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe says to chop the red onion, fry it, and then prepare the meal. So far, they've tried to chop the red onion but were told they need a knife. They tried using the knife on the red onion, but the system said that's not a recognized verb.

Hmm, maybe the correct action is to use the knife to chop the onion. The error message said "Cutting something requires a knife," so perhaps the command should be "chop the red onion with the knife" or "use the knife to chop the red onion." But the system might expect a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the knife is already in the right place, and the correct command is just "chop the red onion" again. Wait, the user tried "chop the red onion" and got a response that they need a knife. Then they tried "use knife on red onion," which was invalid. So maybe the correct action is to use the knife on the onion to chop it. But the system might require a specific verb. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user has the knife on the counter. The recipe says to chop the red onion. The system says cutting requires a knife. So the correct action is probably "chop the red onion with the knife" or "use the knife to chop the red onion." But the system might not accept "with the knife." Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "chop the red onion" again, assuming the knife is already taken into account. But the user was told they need a knife, so they must use it. Maybe the correct command is "use the knife on the red onion" but that was invalid. Wait, the user tried "use knife on red onion" and got "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct verb is "chop" and the object is the onion, and the knife is already in the right place. Maybe the system expects "chop the red onion" again, but the user needs to have the knife in hand first. Wait, the user is at the counter, which has the knife. So maybe the correct action is to take the knife first, then chop the onion. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the steps would be: take the knife, then chop the onion. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to take the knife, then chop the onion. But the user's last action was "use knife on red onion," which was invalid. So perhaps the correct command is "take knife" first. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. Let me check the environment again. The counter has a cookbook and a knife. So the user is at the counter. The correct sequence would be: take the knife, then chop the red onion. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the next action should be "take knife," then "chop the red onion." But the user is trying to chop the onion directly. So maybe the correct action is to take the knife first. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to take the knife, then chop the onion. But the user's last action was "use knife on red onion," which was invalid. So the correct action now is to take the knife first. Therefore, the next command should be "take knife."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to chop the red onion using the knife. They tried "chop the red onion" but got a message saying cutting requires a knife. Then they tried "use knife on red onion," which was invalid. Now they need to figure out the correct command.

Wait, maybe the correct verb is "cut" instead of "chop"? The recipe says "chop the red onion," but maybe the game expects "cut" as the verb. Alternatively, maybe the action is "cut the red onion with the knife." But the system might not accept "with the knife." Or perhaps the knife is already in hand, so just "cut the red onion."

But the user has the knife now after taking it. So the next step is to use the knife to cut the onion. The previous attempt was "use knife on red onion," which wasn't recognized. Maybe the correct command is "cut the red onion" without mentioning the knife, since the knife is already in hand. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user took the knife, so now they can cut the onion. The system might accept "cut the red onion" as the command. Alternatively, maybe "chop the red onion" is the correct verb, but the system said cutting requires a knife, so maybe "cut" is the right verb here. Let's try "cut the red onion."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cut the red onion using the knife. The previous attempts have been "chop the red onion," "use knife on red onion," and "cut the red onion with the knife." Each time, there's some kind of error or confusion.

The game's response after "cut the red onion with the knife" was that it only understood up to wanting to cut the onion. So maybe the correct command is just "cut the red onion" without specifying the knife, since the knife is already in hand. Alternatively, maybe the verb is "slice" or "dice" as options, but the recipe says "chop."

Wait, the recipe says "chop the red onion," so maybe the correct action is "chop the red onion" again. But the system said "Cutting something requires a knife," which might mean that "chop" is not the right verb here. Maybe the correct verb is "cut," and the user needs to use "cut" instead of "chop." But the recipe says "chop," so maybe the game expects that exact term.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the knife on the onion after taking it. But the user already took the knife. So the next step is to use the knife to chop the onion. The previous attempt was "use knife on red onion," which was invalid. Maybe the correct command is "chop the red onion with the knife," but the system didn't recognize that.

Hmm, the user is stuck. The correct action might be "chop the red onion" again, even though the system said cutting requires a knife. Maybe the system is confused, but the recipe says to chop, so that's the command to use. Alternatively, the user might need to use "cut" instead of "chop." But the recipe specifies "chop," so maybe that's the right term. Let's try "chop the red onion" one more time.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe says to chop the red onion, fry it, and prepare the meal. So far, the user has tried several actions but kept running into issues with the knife and the correct verbs.

First, the user tried "chop the red onion" but was told that cutting requires a knife. Then they tried "use knife on red onion," which wasn't recognized. After taking the knife, they tried "cut the red onion with the knife," but the system only understood up to cutting. Finally, they tried "cut the red onion" again, which worked, but the system mentioned the options of slice, dice, or chop.

Now, the user is at the starting point again, looking around the kitchen. The goal is to follow the recipe steps. The next step after chopping the onion would be to fry it. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the current prompt is after the user tried "cut the red onion" and the system responded with the options. The user is now at the kitchen again, so maybe they need to proceed with the next step in the recipe, which is to fry the red onion.

But the user's last action was "cut the red onion," which was successful. Now, the next step is to fry it. The oven is closed, but the stove is empty. Maybe the user needs to use the stove to fry the onion. So the next action should be to fry the red onion. However, the user might need to check if the stove is usable or if there's a way to heat it. Alternatively, maybe the oven can be used, but the recipe says to fry, not bake.

So the correct next step is to fry the red onion. The user should use the stove. But since the stove is empty, maybe they need to put the chopped onion into it. So the command would be "fry the red onion" or "put the red onion in the stove." But the recipe says "fry the red onion," so the action should be "fry the red onion."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The recipe says to chop the red onion, fry it, and prepare the meal. So far, the user has tried chopping the onion but kept having issues with the knife and the correct verbs. They tried "chop the red onion," "use knife on red onion," "cut the red onion with the knife," and finally "cut the red onion," which worked but the system mentioned the options of slice, dice, or chop.

Now, the user is at the kitchen again, looking around. The available commands include "look," "goal," "inventory," "go," "examine," "eat," "open," "close," "drop," "take," "put," "take from," "insert," "lock," "unlock." The user needs to proceed with the recipe steps.

After cutting the onion, the next step is to fry it. The user tried "fry the red onion" but got an error. Then they tried "heat the stove," which was accepted. Now, they need to actually fry the onion. Since the stove is empty, maybe they need to put the chopped onion into the stove. But the correct command might be "put the red onion in the stove" or "fry the red onion on the stove." However, the recipe says "fry the red onion," so the action should be "fry the red onion." But the system said that's not a verb. Maybe the correct command is "put the red onion in the stove" or "place the red onion on the stove." Alternatively, since the stove is empty, they need to add the onion to it. So the next step is to put the chopped onion into the stove to fry it. The user has the onion in their inventory now, so they can put it into the stove. The command would be "put the red onion in the stove" or "put the red onion on the stove." Let's check the available commands again. The "put ... on ..." command is available. So the correct action is "put the red onion on the stove." That should fry it according to the recipe.

You've entered a kitchen.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. The fridge contains a raw red potato, a white onion, a green bell pepper and an orange bell pepper. You check the price tag on the fridge. 80 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You can make out a closed oven nearby. You see a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You scan the room, seeing a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the stove you can see a red onion.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe. The recipe says to chop the red onion, fry it, and prepare the meal. So far, they've managed to chop the onion and put it on the stove. Now, the next step is to fry it. But the user is stuck again.

Looking at the available commands, the user can "examine" something more closely. Maybe they need to check if the stove is hot enough or if there's a way to ignite it. Alternatively, they might need to add oil or butter to the stove before frying. But the recipe doesn't mention that, so maybe the game expects a different action.

Wait, the recipe says "fry the red onion," so the next step is to fry it. The user has the onion on the stove. Maybe the correct command is "fry the red onion," but the system might not recognize that. Alternatively, they might need to use the "examine" command to check the stove's state. Or perhaps they need to "turn on" the stove. But the available commands don't include "turn on." The user can "open" the oven, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "put" something else on the stove, but the recipe only mentions the onion. The user has the onion on the stove, so maybe the next step is to "cook" it. But "cook" isn't a command. The available commands include "put ... on ...," so maybe they need to put the onion on the stove again, but it's already there.

Wait, the user just put the onion on the stove. The system says "You put the red onion on the stove." Now, the next step is to fry it. The user might need to "fry the red onion" again, but the system said that's not a verb. Maybe the correct command is "heat the stove" again, but they already did that. Alternatively, they might need to "examine the stove" to see if it's ready. Or maybe they need to "add oil to the stove" but that's not in the commands.

Hmm, the user is at the kitchen again, looking around. The available commands include "examine," so maybe they should examine the stove to see if it's ready for frying. That makes sense. So the next action should be "examine stove" to check if it's hot enough. Then, after examining, they can proceed to fry the onion. But the user needs to use the correct command. The available commands include "examine," so the next step is to examine the stove.

Okay, the user is trying to fry the red onion but the command "fry the red onion" isn't recognized. The available commands include "examine," "put," "take," "open," etc. The previous step was examining the stove, which was useful for frying. Now, since the stove is on and the onion is there, maybe the next step is to "put the red onion on the stove" again, but it's already there. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "cook the red onion" but that's not a command. The correct action might be to "use the stove to fry the onion," but the command structure might require "fry" as a verb. Since "fry" isn't working, perhaps the user needs to use "heat" instead. But the user already heated the stove. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "cook the red onion," but that's not in the list. Wait, the available commands include "put ... on ...", so maybe the user needs to put the onion on the stove again, but it's already there. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "add something to the stove" like oil, but that's not in the recipe. The recipe just says to fry the onion. Since the system doesn't recognize "fry," maybe the correct command is "cook" but it's not available. The user has to use the available commands. The previous step was examining the stove, so maybe the next step is to "put the red onion on the stove" again, but it's already there. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "use the stove" to cook it. But the correct command might be "fry" even if it's not recognized. Alternatively, the user might need to "examine the red onion" to see if it's ready. But the goal is to prepare the meal. The user is close, but the system is not recognizing the correct command. The next step might be to "cook the red onion" even if it's not in the commands. But the user has to stick to the available commands. The correct action is probably "put the red onion on the stove" again, but it's already there. Maybe the user needs to "use the stove" to cook it. But the correct command is "fry," which isn't recognized. The user is stuck, but the next action should be "fry the red onion" again, even if it's not recognized. Alternatively, the user might need to "cook" it, but that's not a command. The answer is to use "fry" even if it's not recognized, but the system says it's not a verb. So the user has to try another command. The available commands include "put," so maybe "put the red onion on the stove" again. But it's already there. Maybe the user needs to "examine the red onion" to check if it's cooked. But the goal is to prepare the meal. The user is close, so the next action is "fry the red onion" again.

Let's see, the previous steps: they chopped the onion, put it on the stove, examined the stove, and now they're trying to cook it. The system says "You need to take the red onion first." Wait, but the onion is already on the stove. Maybe the user needs to take it from the stove first? But why? The recipe says to fry it, so maybe the correct step is to put it in the oven instead? But the recipe says fry, not bake. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to take the onion from the stove to cook it. But the system is confusing. The user has the onion on the stove, so maybe the next step is to "put the red onion in the oven" even though the recipe says fry. But the oven is closed. The user needs to open it. So the steps would be: open the oven, put the onion inside, then close it. But the recipe says fry, not bake. Hmm. The user is stuck because the system doesn't recognize "cook" or "fry." The correct action might be to "put the red onion in the oven" even if it's not specified. Alternatively, since the stove is already on, maybe the onion is already frying. But the user needs to proceed to the next step in the recipe, which is "prepare the meal." So maybe the next action is to "prepare the meal" even if it's not a command.
