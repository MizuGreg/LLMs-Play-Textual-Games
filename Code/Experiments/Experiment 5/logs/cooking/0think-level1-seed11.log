You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
Guess what, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a red hot pepper, a carrot, a lettuce and a block of cheese. You wonder idly who left that here. You make out a closed oven right there by you. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a cookbook and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.
