You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A standard kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.

Were you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains a red onion, a raw red potato, a yellow onion and a yellow bell pepper. You make out a closed oven. You can make out a table. However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. You see a tomato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.
