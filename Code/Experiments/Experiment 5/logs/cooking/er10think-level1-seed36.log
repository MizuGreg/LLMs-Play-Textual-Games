You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the kitchen.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains a white onion, a raw white tuna and a red onion. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see an oven. You can see a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. This always happens!

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to dice the white onion using the knife. They've tried "dice the white onion" and "use knife on white onion", but the game isn't recognizing those commands. The error messages suggest that "dice" isn't a valid verb here. Maybe the correct action is to use the knife to cut the onion. The user tried "use knife on white onion" but got an error. Perhaps the correct syntax is "cut the white onion with the knife" or something similar. Alternatively, maybe the game expects a different verb like "slice" or "chop". Since the recipe says "dice the white onion", but the game doesn't accept "dice", maybe the user needs to use the knife directly. The previous attempt was "use knife on white onion", which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "cut white onion with knife". But the game might have specific verbs. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first cut the onion and then fry it. Wait, the user has the knife and the onion. The next step is to cut the onion. Since "dice" isn't working, perhaps the correct action is to "cut the white onion" using the knife. But the game might require the knife to be used in a specific way. Maybe "cut the white onion with the knife". But the game's response was that "use knife on white onion" isn't a verb. Maybe the correct verb is "cut". So the user should try "cut the white onion". Let me check the previous steps. The user has the knife and the onion. The correct action is to cut the onion. The game might accept "cut the white onion" as the command. Alternatively, maybe "cut white onion with knife". But the user tried "use knife on white onion" and it didn't work. The game might require the verb "cut" without specifying the tool. So the next step is to try "cut the white onion".

You need to specify how you want to cut the white onion. Either slice, dice, or chop it.

Okay, the user is trying to cut the white onion with the knife in the kitchen game. They've tried several commands like "cut the white onion", "slice the white onion", "use knife on white onion", but the game isn't recognizing them. The error messages indicate that the verbs used aren't valid here. The recipe says to "dice the white onion", but the game might not accept "dice" as a verb. The user has the knife and the onion, so the next step is to use the knife to cut the onion. Since "use knife on white onion" didn't work, maybe the correct command is "cut white onion with knife". But the game keeps saying it only understood up to cutting the onion. Maybe the game expects a different verb or a specific phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first cut the onion and then fry it. But the main issue is the verb recognition. The user might need to try a different verb like "slice" or "chop" with the knife. However, the game's response suggests that "cut" is the intended verb but needs to be combined with the knife. The correct command might be "cut white onion with knife" or "slice white onion with knife". Since the user tried "cut white onion with knife" multiple times and it's not working, maybe the game expects a simpler command like "cut onion" or "cut with knife". But the user has the white onion, so specifying "white onion" is necessary. The next step is to try "cut white onion with knife" again, but the game isn't accepting it. Maybe the game requires the knife to be used in a specific way, like "use knife to cut white onion". But the user tried that and it didn't work. The user is stuck on this step, so the next action should be to try a different verb or phrasing that the game might accept.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck on cutting the white onion with the knife. They've tried multiple commands, but the game isn't recognizing them. The error messages suggest that the verbs used aren't valid. The recipe says to "dice the white onion", but the game might not accept "dice" as a verb. The user has the knife and the onion, so the next step is to use the knife to cut the onion. Since "use knife on white onion" didn't work, maybe the correct command is "cut white onion with knife". But the game keeps saying it only understood up to cutting the onion. Maybe the game expects a different verb or a specific phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first cut the onion and then fry it. But the main issue is the verb recognition. The user might need to try a different verb like "slice" or "chop" with the knife. However, the game's response suggests that "cut" is the intended verb but needs to be combined with the knife. The correct command might be "cut white onion with knife" or "slice white onion with knife". Since the user tried "cut white onion with knife" multiple times and it's not working, maybe the game requires the knife to be used in a specific way, like "use knife to cut white onion". But the user tried that and it didn't work. The user is stuck on this step, so the next action should be to try a different verb or phrasing that the game might accept.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck on cutting the white onion with the knife. They've tried multiple commands, but the game isn't recognizing them. The error messages suggest that the verbs used aren't valid. The recipe says to "dice the white onion", but the game might not accept "dice" as a verb. The user has the knife and the onion, so the next step is to use the knife to cut the onion. Since "use knife on white onion" didn't work, maybe the correct command is "cut white onion with knife". But the game keeps saying it only understood up to cutting the onion. Maybe the game expects a different verb or a specific phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first cut the onion and then fry it. But the main issue is the verb recognition. The user might need to try a different verb like "slice" or "chop" with the knife. However, the game's response suggests that "cut" is the intended verb but needs to be combined with the knife. The correct command might be "cut white onion with knife" or "slice white onion with knife". Since the user tried "cut white onion with knife" multiple times and it's not working, maybe the game requires the knife to be used in a specific way, like "use knife to cut white onion". But the user tried that and it didn't work. The user is stuck on this step, so the next action should be to try a different verb or phrasing that the game might accept.
