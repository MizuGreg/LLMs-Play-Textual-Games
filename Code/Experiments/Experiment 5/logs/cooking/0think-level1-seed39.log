You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

Oh, great. Here's a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a carrot, a raw pork chop and a raw red tuna. You make out a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a green apple, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Huh, weird. You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.
