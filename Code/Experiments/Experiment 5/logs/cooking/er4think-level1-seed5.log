You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You're now in the kitchen.

You make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion, a red bell pepper and a carrot. You see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a counter. You see a banana on the counter. You make out a stove. But the thing is empty.

Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user is in the kitchen, and the goal is to cook a meal. They found a cookbook, but it wasn't openable. Then they looked around but couldn't find anything else. The fridge has ingredients like pork chop, onion, bell pepper, and carrot. There's a stove, but it's empty. The table has a cookbook and a knife. The user tried to open the cookbook but couldn't. Maybe the cookbook is not openable, so they need to find another way.

Wait, the user is hungry and needs to cook. The ingredients are there. Maybe they need to use the stove. But the stove is empty. So perhaps they need to prepare the ingredients. The knife is on the table, so maybe they can chop the vegetables. But the user hasn't used the knife yet. Let me check the previous actions. The user first checked the cookbook, tried to open it, then looked around. The next step might be to use the knife to prepare the ingredients. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is a clue. Since it's not openable, maybe the recipe is in the cookbook's description. But the user can't open it. Maybe they need to find the recipe another way. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove. But the stove is empty. So maybe they need to put the ingredients into the stove. But how?

Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the fridge has the ingredients. The table has a knife. So maybe the next step is to take the knife and chop the vegetables. Then put them on the stove. But the stove is empty. So maybe the user needs to use the knife to chop the ingredients first. Let me think: the user is in the kitchen, has the ingredients, and the knife. The next action should be to take the knife and chop the vegetables. But the user hasn't done that yet. The previous actions were looking around and trying to open the cookbook. So the next step is probably to take the knife and start preparing the ingredients. So the command would be to take the knife. But the user might need to use the knife to chop the vegetables. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove. But the stove is empty. So maybe the user needs to put the ingredients into the stove. But the stove is empty. So maybe the user needs to use the knife to chop the pork chop and vegetables, then put them on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to take the knife. But the user is in the kitchen, and the knife is on the table. So the command would be to take the knife. Then use it to chop the ingredients. But the user hasn't taken the knife yet. So the next action is to take the knife.

Okay, the user has taken the knife from the table. Now, they need to use it to prepare the ingredients. The ingredients are in the fridge: raw pork chop, white onion, red bell pepper, and carrot. The next logical step is to chop these vegetables. Since the knife is available, the user should probably chop the onion and carrot first. But the game might require specific actions. Maybe they need to take the ingredients from the fridge first. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the fridge is accessible. So maybe the next step is to open the fridge and take the ingredients. But the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, since the knife is taken, they can start chopping. But the ingredients are in the fridge. So the user needs to take the ingredients first. Let me check the previous steps. The user is in the kitchen, saw the fridge with ingredients, but didn't take them. So the next action should be to open the fridge and take the ingredients. But the user hasn't opened the fridge yet. So the next command should be to open the fridge. But the user might need to take the ingredients first. Alternatively, maybe they can chop the ingredients directly from the fridge. But the game might require taking them first. So the correct next action is to open the fridge. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the answer is to open the fridge.

Okay, the user has chopped the pork chop. Now they need to handle the other ingredients. The next step is to chop the onion, bell pepper, and carrot. Since they have the knife, they can proceed to chop each vegetable. The user might need to take each ingredient from the fridge first. Wait, the fridge is already open, so they can take the onion, bell pepper, and carrot. But the user hasn't taken those yet. So the next action should be to take the onion. Alternatively, they might need to chop the onion next. But the game might require taking the ingredients first. So the correct next step is to take the onion from the fridge.

But the order might matter. The user has already taken the pork chop and onion. The next logical step is to take the bell pepper. So the next action is to take the red bell pepper from the fridge.

Okay, the user is trying to put the ingredients in the stove, but the game says they can't see any such thing. Maybe the stove is empty, so they need to put the chopped ingredients into it. The user has already chopped all the ingredients: pork chop, onion, bell pepper, and carrot. They need to place them in the stove. But the stove is empty. The correct command might be to put the ingredients into the stove. Since the user has them, they can use the command "put ingredients in stove" or "put all in stove". But the game didn't recognize it. Maybe the correct command is "put pork chop in stove" and similarly for the others. But that's tedious. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove's interface. Since the stove is empty, they can put the ingredients there. The next action should be to put the ingredients into the stove.

Okay, the user just put the pork chop into the oven. Now they need to add the other ingredients. The next step is to put the onion into the oven. The user has the onion, so the command would be "put onion in oven". Let me check the previous steps. The user has already chopped the onion, so they can now place it in the oven. The next action is to put the onion into the oven.

Okay, the user has put all the ingredients into the oven. Now they need to close the oven and maybe wait for it to cook. The previous steps showed that the oven was opened, and all ingredients are inside. The next logical step is to close the oven. The command would be "close oven". Then, maybe the game will trigger the meal being cooked. Let me check the previous interactions. The user has successfully placed all ingredients in the oven. The next action is to close it.

Okay, the user is in the kitchen, has cooked all the ingredients in the oven, and closed it. The next step is to wait for the oven to cook the meal. But the game didn't recognize the previous command. The user needs to try again. The correct command is "wait for oven to cook" or "wait". Since the user tried "wait for oven to cook" and it didn't work, maybe the simpler command is "wait". Let me check the previous steps. The user closed the oven, so the next action is to wait. The command should be "wait".

Okay, the user is in the kitchen, and the oven has finished cooking. The previous action was waiting, and time passed. The meal is ready. The user needs to enjoy the meal.
