You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You're now in the kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a red bell pepper, a yellow onion, a raw white tuna and a white onion. You can see an oven. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to cook a meal. The goal is to follow a recipe from the cookbook and then enjoy the meal. So far, they've tried to open the cookbook but couldn't. Then they looked around, but didn't find anything. Now they're asking if they're on the right track and what their next move should be.

First, I need to recall the environment. The kitchen has a fridge with various vegetables and tuna, an oven, a stove, a table with a cookbook and a knife, and some strange noises. The user tried to open the cookbook but it wasn't possible. Maybe the cookbook is in a different place or needs to be accessed another way. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the recipe first.

Since the cookbook is on the table, perhaps the user needs to pick it up. But the previous attempt to open it failed. Maybe the cookbook is closed, so they need to open it first. But the user tried that and it didn't work. Wait, maybe the user needs to look at the cookbook to find the recipe. Or maybe the cookbook is a book that needs to be opened, but the game doesn't allow that action. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the ingredients first.

The user is hungry and needs to cook. The fridge has ingredients. The stove and oven are available. The table has a knife. The user might need to gather ingredients, prepare them, and then cook. But the main issue is accessing the recipe. Since the cookbook is on the table, maybe the next step is to take the cookbook. Then, perhaps read it or find the recipe. But the user tried to open it and it didn't work. Maybe the action is to look at the cookbook instead of open it. Or maybe the user needs to find the recipe in the kitchen elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the fridge for ingredients needed for a recipe. The cookbook might have a recipe that requires specific items. The user has to find the recipe first. Since the cookbook is on the table, perhaps the next step is to take the cookbook. Then, look through it to find the recipe. But the user tried to open it and it didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to take the cookbook first. Let me check the previous steps again.

In the initial state, the user is in the kitchen. The table has a cookbook and a knife. The user tried to open the cookbook but it wasn't possible. Then they looked around but couldn't find anything. So maybe the next step is to take the cookbook. Then, perhaps the recipe is in the cookbook, and once it's taken, the user can read it. But the game might require the user to open the cookbook after taking it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look at the cookbook to find the recipe. So the next action should be to take the cookbook. Then, perhaps look at it to find the recipe. But the user tried to open it and it didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to take the cookbook first. So the next command should be "take cookbook" or "pick up cookbook". Then, once it's taken, the user can look at it to find the recipe. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the recipe in the kitchen elsewhere. But given the current state, the cookbook is on the table. So the next step is to take it. Then, perhaps the recipe is available. So the answer should be to take the cookbook.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to chop the red onion. But when they tried to chop it, the game mentioned that cutting something requires a knife. The user currently has the red onion and the knife is on the table. So the next step should be to take the knife. Then they can use it to chop the onion. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user took the cookbook and looked at it. The recipe says to chop the red onion. The knife is on the table, so they need to pick it up first. Then, with the knife, they can chop the onion. So the next action should be to take the knife. Then, after getting the knife, chop the onion. But the user hasn't picked up the knife yet. So the correct next step is to take the knife.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to chop the red onion, but the game says they need to take the onion first. Wait, they already have the red onion in their inventory, right? Because earlier they took the cookbook and then the knife. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me check the history.

The user took the cookbook and then the knife. Then they tried to chop the red onion, but the game said they need to take the onion first. Wait, maybe the red onion is still on the table. Oh, right! The user had the red onion from the fridge, but maybe they didn't pick it up yet. Wait, the initial fridge contents included a red onion. So the user needs to take the red onion from the fridge first, then chop it with the knife. But in the previous steps, the user didn't pick up the onion. So the next action should be to take the red onion from the fridge. Then, with the knife, chop it. So the correct next step is to take the red onion.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to chop the red onion with the knife. They tried "chop red onion with knife" but got an error. The game says that's not a recognized verb. So maybe the correct command is just "chop red onion" since the knife is already in hand. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the knife first. Wait, the user took the knife from the table earlier. So perhaps the correct action is to chop the onion without specifying the knife, as the knife is already available. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user took the knife from the table. Then they tried to chop the onion but got an error. The game might expect the command to be "chop red onion" without mentioning the knife, since the knife is already in the inventory. So the next action should be "chop red onion".

The oven is in the kitchen, so the next action should be to put the chopped onion in the oven. But wait, the user has the chopped onion in their inventory? Or did they drop it? The game might require them to put it in the oven. So the correct command would be "put red onion in oven". Alternatively, maybe "roast red onion" directly. But according to the recipe, after chopping, the next step is to roast it. So the user needs to roast the onion. But the oven is available. So the next action is to roast the red onion using the oven. The command would be "roast red onion" or "put red onion in oven". Let me check the previous steps.

Okay, the user is trying to roast the red onion but the game doesn't recognize "roast" as a verb. Earlier, they tried "chop red onion" which worked, but "roast" isn't valid. Maybe the correct action is to use the oven. Since the oven is in the kitchen, perhaps the next step is to put the onion in the oven. But the user already tried "put red onion in oven" and got an error. Wait, maybe the command should be "put red onion in oven" but the game expects a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to open the oven first. Let me check the environment again. The oven is conventional, but the user hasn't interacted with it yet. Maybe the correct action is to open the oven, then put the onion in. But the user's last attempt was "put red onion in oven", which didn't work. Perhaps the correct command is "put red onion in the oven" with the article "the". Or maybe the oven is already open. Alternatively, the user might need to use the verb "place" instead of "put". But the game might have specific commands. Since "roast" isn't working, maybe the next step is to use the oven's function. The correct command could be "put red onion in oven" but with the correct syntax. Alternatively, the user might need to "place red onion in oven". But the game might require a different approach. Given the previous successful "chop" command, maybe "roast" is supposed to be a verb but isn't recognized. So the user should try using the oven's action. The correct next step is to put the onion in the oven. The command should be "put red onion in oven" but maybe the game expects "put" without "in". Or maybe "put red onion into oven". But the user tried "put red onion in oven" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "put red onion into oven". Alternatively, the user needs to open the oven first. Let me think again. The user has the red onion and the knife. The oven is in the kitchen. The next step is to roast the onion, which requires putting it in the oven. So the correct command is "put red onion in oven". But the game says it's not a recognized verb. Maybe the correct action is to "place red onion in oven". Alternatively, the user might need to use the oven's name. Since the oven is called "oven", maybe the command is "put red onion in oven". But the game didn't accept it. Maybe the user needs to use the verb "place" instead of "put".

Okay, the user tried to "wait for oven to roast" but the game says that's not a recognized verb. The previous steps involved putting the red onion in the oven. Now, the next logical step is to check if the onion is roasted. Since the oven is on, maybe the user needs to check the oven's contents. Alternatively, maybe the game expects a different command like "check oven" or "look in oven". But the user needs to follow the recipe steps. The recipe said after chopping, roast the onion. So perhaps the user needs to let it roast, but the game doesn't have a "wait" command. Maybe the correct action is to "take red onion from oven" once it's done. But how does the game know when it's roasted? Maybe the user needs to check the oven. Alternatively, the game might automatically proceed when the oven is open. Since the user put the onion in, maybe the next step is to take it out once it's roasted. But the game doesn't have a timer. Maybe the correct command is "take red onion from oven". Let me think. The user has the onion in the oven. The next step after putting it in is to take it out once it's roasted. But since the game doesn't have a "wait" command, maybe the user needs to check the oven. However, the user can't see inside. So the correct action might be to "take red onion from oven" assuming it's roasted. But the game might require the user to wait. Since "wait" isn't a verb, maybe the correct action is to "check oven" or "look in oven". But the user can't see anything. Alternatively, the game might proceed to the next step automatically. Since the user is following the recipe, the next step after roasting is to prepare the meal. Maybe the user needs to "prepare meal" or "finish meal". But the recipe says "prepare meal" after roasting. So the correct command is "prepare meal".

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, the user is trying to finish the meal but the game isn't recognizing the command. The previous steps involved chopping and roasting the red onion. The recipe says after roasting, prepare the meal. The user might need to use the correct verb here. Since "prepare" didn't work, maybe "cook" or "serve" is the right command. Alternatively, since the oven is already used, maybe the meal is ready, and the user just needs to eat it. But the game might require a specific action. The user has the onion in the oven, which is roasted. So the next step is to take it out and eat. But the game might have a command like "take red onion from oven" or "eat red onion". Since the user can't eat it directly, maybe the correct action is to "take red onion from oven" to use it in the meal. Let me check the previous steps again. The user put the onion in the oven, now it's roasted. So the next step is to take it out. The correct command would be "take red onion from oven".

Okay, the user has taken the red onion from the oven. Now, according to the recipe, they need to prepare the meal. The previous steps were chopping and roasting the onion. Since the onion is now roasted, the next step is to use it in the meal. The recipe might require combining it with other ingredients, but the user only has the red onion so far. Maybe the meal is considered prepared once the onion is roasted and taken out. Alternatively, the game might consider the meal ready after roasting. Since the user has followed the recipe steps, the next action could be to eat the meal. But the game might require a specific command like "eat red onion" or "finish meal". Since the user is in the kitchen, maybe they need to "serve meal" or "prepare meal". However, the correct command based on the recipe is "prepare meal" but that didn't work before. Alternatively, since the onion is ready, the user can "eat red onion". Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "prepare meal" and "finish meal" but got errors. So the correct action here is to eat the roasted onion. The command would be "eat red onion".
