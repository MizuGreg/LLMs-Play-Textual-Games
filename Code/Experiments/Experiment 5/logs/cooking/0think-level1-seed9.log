You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You see a fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You can see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a green apple, a green bell pepper and a yellow apple. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.
