You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've just walked into a kitchen. The room is well lit.

An open fridge is right there by you. The fridge contains a yellow onion, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw white tuna and an orange bell pepper. You can make out an oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? You see a knife on the table. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a tomato and a cookbook. You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.
