You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

Welcome to the kitchen.

You can see a fridge. The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a green apple, a green hot pepper and a white onion. You make out a closed oven close by. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a knife. You can see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You move on, clearly upset with TextWorld.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe for Recipe #1 requires slicing the green bell pepper. The user tried to slice it but was told they need a knife. Wait, the user already has a knife on the counter. Let me check the environment again.

In the kitchen, the counter has a raw red potato, yellow potato, purple potato, and a knife. So the knife is available. The user probably forgot to pick up the knife. So the next step is to take the knife, then slice the green bell pepper. But the user is at the step where they tried to slice the pepper and were told a knife is needed. So the correct action is to take the knife first. But the user's last action was "slice the green bell pepper", which failed because the knife wasn't used. So the next action should be to take the knife, then use it to slice the pepper. But the user's next command should be to take the knife. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the knife is on the counter. So the user needs to pick up the knife first. Then, after taking the knife, they can slice the pepper. So the next action is to take the knife.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to slice the green bell pepper, but they were told that cutting requires a knife. Wait, they just took the knife from the counter. So the knife is now in their inventory. The error message says "Cutting something requires a knife," but they already have the knife. Maybe the game is checking if the knife is equipped or if they're holding it. So the next step is to use the knife to slice the pepper. The command should be "slice the green bell pepper" again, but this time with the knife. Alternatively, maybe they need to "use the knife on the green bell pepper" or "cut the green bell pepper with the knife." But the game's previous commands used "slice," so maybe just slicing again is correct. Let me check the previous steps. The user took the knife, then tried to slice, but the game said a knife is needed. Wait, maybe the knife wasn't picked up correctly. But the user said they took the knife. Hmm. Maybe the correct action is to "slice the green bell pepper" again, assuming the knife is now available. The game might have a delay in recognizing the knife. So the next action is to slice again.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to slice the green bell pepper but keeps getting errors. They tried "slice the green bell pepper" multiple times, but the game says a knife is needed. They took the knife from the counter, so it's in their inventory. The problem is probably that the game expects a specific command structure. The user tried "use knife on green bell pepper" and "use knife to slice green bell pepper," but those weren't recognized. Maybe the correct command is "slice the green bell pepper with the knife." Alternatively, the game might require using the knife first. Since the user has the knife, they need to use it to slice. The correct command might be "slice the green bell pepper" again, but the game is strict. Alternatively, "cut the green bell pepper with the knife." But the game's previous commands used "slice," so maybe that's the right verb. Let me try "slice the green bell pepper" once more.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to fry the green bell pepper. They tried "use the oven to fry the green bell pepper" but got an error. The game might expect a different command. Maybe "fry the green bell pepper in the oven" or "put the green bell pepper in the oven to fry." Since the oven is closed, they might need to open it first. Wait, the recipe says "fry the green bell pepper," so maybe the correct command is "fry the green bell pepper" again, assuming the oven is ready. Alternatively, "cook the green bell pepper in the oven." But the game might require using the oven's actions. Let me check the previous steps. The user has the green bell pepper sliced. The next step is to fry it. The correct command might be "fry the green bell pepper" without specifying the oven, as the oven is already in the kitchen. Let me try that.

Okay, the user opened the oven. Now they need to put the green bell pepper inside to fry it. The next step is to place the pepper in the oven. The correct command would be "put the green bell pepper in the oven." Let me check if that's the right verb. Since the oven is open now, putting the pepper in should work. So the next action is to put the green bell pepper in the oven.
