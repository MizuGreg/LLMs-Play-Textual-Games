You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop and a lettuce! You can make out a closed conventional looking oven close by. You can see a table. You see a knife on the table. You can see a counter. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a kitchen game where they need to cook a meal. The cookbook says to dice the pork chop, roast it, and prepare the meal. So far, they've looked at the cookbook and seen the ingredients and directions. The fridge has a raw pork chop and lettuce, but the stove is empty. The user needs to follow the recipe steps.

First, they need to get the pork chop from the fridge. Then, they have to dice it. The knife is on the table, so they can use that. After dicing, roast the pork chop in the oven. Wait, the oven is closed. They need to open it. Then, put the roasted pork chop on the stove? Or maybe the oven is for roasting. The directions say "roast the pork chop," so the oven is the right place. 

But the user hasn't picked up the pork chop yet. So the next step should be to take the pork chop from the fridge. Then, dice it with the knife. Then, put it in the oven. But the oven is closed, so they need to open it first. Then roast. After that, prepare the meal. Maybe the lettuce is part of the meal, but the recipe only lists pork chop as an ingredient. Hmm. The directions are a bit vague. But following the steps: dice, roast, prepare. So the user needs to take the pork chop, dice it, roast it in the oven, then prepare the meal. 

The user's previous actions were looking at the cookbook, but they couldn't open it. Then they looked around and at the cookbook again. Now, the next step is to take the pork chop from the fridge. So the command should be "take pork chop from fridge" or something similar. But in the game's context, maybe "take pork chop" is enough. Alternatively, "get pork chop from fridge." The user needs to pick up the ingredient first. So the next action is to take the pork chop from the fridge.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to dice the pork chop. They have the pork chop and the knife on the table. The previous attempts to use the knife resulted in errors. The user tried "use knife on pork chop" and "use knife to dice pork chop", but the game didn't recognize those.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is to use the knife on the pork chop to dice it. But the game might expect a specific phrasing. Since "dice" is part of the recipe's directions, perhaps the action is to "dice pork chop with knife". Alternatively, maybe the game expects "cut pork chop with knife" or "slice pork chop with knife". But the recipe says "dice", so maybe the correct command is "dice pork chop".

Wait, the user already took the pork chop from the fridge. Now they need to dice it. The knife is on the table. So the correct action might be "cut pork chop with knife" or "dice pork chop with knife". But the game might have specific verbs. Since the previous attempts didn't work, maybe the correct command is "cut pork chop with knife". Alternatively, maybe "use knife to cut pork chop".

But the user's last attempt was "use knife to dice pork chop", which didn't work. The game says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe "dice" isn't the right verb here. Perhaps the correct action is to "cut" the pork chop with the knife. So the next command should be "cut pork chop with knife".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to roast the pork chop in the oven. The previous step was dicing the pork chop, which worked. Now they need to roast it. The game says "roast pork chop in oven" is not a recognized verb. So maybe the correct command is to "put pork chop in oven" or "place pork chop in oven". Since the oven is closed, they might need to open it first. Wait, the user hasn't opened the oven yet. So maybe the steps are: open the oven, put the pork chop inside, then roast it. But the recipe says "roast the pork chop", so perhaps the action is to put it in the oven and then roast. But the game might expect the command "put pork chop in oven" or "roast pork chop". Since "roast" isn't working, maybe "put in oven" is the correct verb. Alternatively, "place pork chop in oven". The user needs to make sure the oven is open. So the next step is to open the oven, then put the pork chop inside. But the user's last action was trying to roast, which didn't work. So the correct command should be "open oven" first, then "put pork chop in oven". But the user might not have opened the oven yet. So the next action should be to open the oven.

Okay, the user is trying to "prepare meal with pork chop" but the game isn't recognizing it. Let me think about the recipe again. The recipe says "prepare meal" after dicing and roasting. Maybe the correct command is just "prepare meal" without specifying the pork chop. Or perhaps "serve meal" or "eat meal". Since the user has already roasted the pork chop, the next step is to prepare the meal, which might just be serving it. The game might expect a simpler command like "serve" or "eat". Let me check previous steps. The user had to dice and roast, now they need to prepare the meal. Maybe the correct action is "serve meal" or "eat pork chop". But the recipe says "prepare meal", so maybe "prepare meal" is the right command, but the game isn't recognizing it. Alternatively, maybe the user just needs to "finish meal" or "complete meal". Since the user is close, maybe the correct command is "serve meal".

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is trying to "enjoy meal" but the game keeps saying it's not a recognized verb. Let me think. The original goal was to cook a delicious meal and enjoy it. The user has already prepared the meal by roasting the pork chop and adding it to their inventory. The next step should be to enjoy the meal. But the game doesn't accept "enjoy" as a verb here. Maybe the correct command is "eat meal" or "consume meal". Alternatively, since the meal is in the inventory, perhaps "use meal" or "eat pork chop". But the recipe says "prepare meal", and the user has done that. Maybe the game expects a different term, like "serve meal" or "finish meal". However, previous attempts at "serve" didn't work. Alternatively, maybe the user just needs to "finish" the meal. But the game isn't recognizing any of these. Wait, the user added the meal to their inventory. Maybe the correct action is to "use meal" or "eat meal". But "enjoy" isn't working. Maybe the game is expecting "eat" instead of "enjoy". Let me check previous steps. The user tried "enjoy your meal" and "enjoy meal" multiple times. Since the game isn't recognizing "enjoy", perhaps the correct command is "eat meal" or "consume meal". But the user has already roasted the pork chop, so maybe "eat pork chop" is the correct action. However, the recipe says "prepare meal", so maybe the correct command is "finish meal". But the game isn't recognizing any of these. Maybe the user needs to just "use" the meal. Alternatively, since the user has completed the recipe steps, the game might automatically consider the meal as prepared. But the user needs to confirm. Maybe the correct command is "complete meal" or "end meal". However, the game is strict with verbs. Given that, the user might need to use "eat" instead of "enjoy". So the next action should be "eat meal".
