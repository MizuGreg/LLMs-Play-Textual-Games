You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An usual one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a red hot pepper and a white onion. Hey, want to see an oven? Look over there, an oven. You see a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. The table is massive. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove! The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to chop the red onion using the knife. But every time they try to use the knife on the onion, it says "That's not a verb I recognise." Wait, maybe the correct command is to use the knife on the onion, but the system is not accepting it. Alternatively, maybe the action is to chop the onion, but the knife is needed.

Wait, the user tried "chop the red onion" earlier, but the system responded that cutting requires a knife. So the user then tried "use knife on red onion", but that's not a recognized verb. Hmm. Maybe the correct verb is "cut" instead of "chop"? Or maybe "slice"? Let me check the previous interactions.

In the recipe, the directions say "chop the red onion", but the system says cutting requires a knife. So perhaps the correct action is to use the knife on the onion to chop it. But the user tried "use knife on red onion" and got an error. Maybe the correct syntax is "cut the red onion with the knife"? Or maybe "use the knife to chop the red onion"?

Alternatively, maybe the game expects the user to first pick up the knife, then use it on the onion. Wait, the user is already in the kitchen with the knife and the onion. So perhaps the correct command is "cut the red onion", but the system requires using the knife. But the user tried that and got an error. Maybe the system is expecting "chop" as the verb, but the knife is needed. Wait, the user tried "chop the red onion" and the system said "Cutting something requires a knife." So the user needs to use the knife to chop it. But when they tried "use knife on red onion", it said that's not a verb. Maybe the correct command is "use knife on red onion" but the system is not recognizing it. Alternatively, maybe the correct verb is "cut" instead of "chop". Let me think.

In the recipe, the directions are "chop the red onion", but the system says cutting requires a knife. So maybe the correct action is to cut the onion with the knife. But the user tried "use knife on red onion" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "cut the red onion with the knife"? Or maybe "use the knife to cut the red onion"? But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first pick up the knife, but the knife is already in the room. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the knife is on the counter. So maybe the user needs to pick up the knife first. But in the previous steps, the user hasn't picked it up yet. Wait, the user is holding the red onion? Or is the onion on the counter?

Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the red onion is in the fridge, but the user hasn't taken it out yet. Wait, no, the initial description says the fridge contains a red onion, a red hot pepper, and a white onion. The user is in the kitchen, and the table is empty. The counter has a cookbook and a knife. So the user needs to take the onion from the fridge, then use the knife to chop it. But the user hasn't taken the onion out yet. Wait, the user tried to chop the onion but didn't take it from the fridge. So maybe the first step is to take the red onion from the fridge. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the user needs to take the onion first, then use the knife to chop it. But in the previous steps, the user tried to chop the onion without taking it from the fridge. So maybe the correct sequence is: take red onion from fridge, then use knife on it. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step should be to take the onion from the fridge. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the user's next action should be to take the red onion from the fridge. Then, once it's in hand, use the knife to chop it. But the user is currently in the kitchen, and the fridge is in the same room. So the user needs to take the onion from the fridge first. But in the previous steps, the user hasn't done that. So the correct next action is to take the red onion from the fridge. Then, after that, use the knife on it. But the user is trying to chop it directly, which is why the system is saying that cutting requires a knife. So the user needs to first take the onion from the fridge, then use the knife on it. Therefore, the next action should be to take the red onion from the fridge.

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is trying to chop a red onion using a knife in a text-based game. The problem is that every time they try to use the knife on the onion, the system says "That's not a verb I recognise." Earlier, they tried "chop the red onion" and were told that cutting requires a knife. Then they tried "use knife on red onion" but got an error. Now they're repeatedly trying "cut red onion with knife" but the system only understands up to "cut the red onion."

Hmm, maybe the game expects a specific command structure. Let me think about the possible correct commands. In many text adventures, you have to use verbs like "cut" or "chop" with the object and possibly the tool. But the system might require the tool to be specified in a certain way. For example, "cut the red onion with the knife" might be the correct syntax, but the system is not recognizing it. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "use the knife to cut the red onion." But the user has tried "cut red onion with knife" and it's not working.

Wait, the user previously took the red onion from the fridge. Now they have the onion in hand. The next step is to chop it. The system says that cutting requires a knife, so the user needs to use the knife. But the system isn't accepting "use knife on red onion" as a valid command. Maybe the correct command is "cut the red onion" after picking up the knife. But the user hasn't picked up the knife yet. Wait, the knife is on the counter. So maybe the user needs to pick up the knife first. But in the previous steps, the user hasn't done that. Let me check the initial setup again.

The user is in the kitchen, and the counter has a cookbook and a knife. So the knife is in the room. The user hasn't picked it up yet. So maybe the correct sequence is: take the knife from the counter, then use it on the onion. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step should be to take the knife first. But the user is trying to cut the onion directly. So maybe the correct command is "take knife from counter" first, then "cut red onion with knife."

But the user hasn't tried that yet. So perhaps the correct next action is to take the knife from the counter. Let me check the previous interactions. The user hasn't picked up the knife yet. So the next step should be to take the knife. Then, after that, use it on the onion. So the correct command would be "take knife from counter." But the user is trying to cut the onion directly. So maybe the system is expecting the user to first take the knife, then use it. Therefore, the next action should be to take the knife from the counter.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is trying to cut the red onion with the knife in the game. They've taken the onion from the fridge and the knife from the counter. But every time they try to use the knife on the onion, the system only understands up to "cut the red onion." The previous attempts to use the knife with the onion are failing.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is just "cut the red onion" without mentioning the knife, since the knife is already in hand. But the system says cutting requires a knife, so maybe the knife needs to be specified. Alternatively, maybe the game expects the user to use the knife as the tool. Wait, in some games, you have to use the command "cut [object] with [tool]." But the user has tried that and it's not working. Maybe the system is expecting a different structure, like "use knife to cut red onion." But the user hasn't tried that yet. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "cut red onion with knife" and the system only understood up to "cut the red onion." So maybe the correct command is "cut the red onion" and the knife is already in hand, so the system is accepting that. But the user needs to make sure the knife is used. Alternatively, maybe the system is not recognizing the "with knife" part. So the next step is to try "cut the red onion" without the knife part. Let me try that.

You need to specify how you want to cut the red onion. Either slice, dice, or chop it.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to fry the red onion in the game. They've already chopped it, but now they need to fry it. The previous attempts to use "fry red onion with pan" are failing because the system doesn't recognize "with pan" as a valid verb. Maybe the correct command is just "fry red onion" without specifying the pan, assuming the user has the pan available. Alternatively, the user might need to first take the pan from the stove or somewhere else. But in the kitchen setup, there's a stove, so maybe the pan is on the stove. The user hasn't picked it up yet. So the correct steps would be: take the pan from the stove, then fry the onion. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to take the pan from the stove. Let me check the initial description again. The stove is conventional but empty. The user is in the kitchen with the knife and the onion. So the pan might be on the stove. Therefore, the next command should be "take pan from stove." But the user is trying to fry the onion directly. Maybe the system expects "fry red onion" without the pan part. Let me try that.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, the user is trying to fry the red onion but keeps getting errors. Let me think about the possible correct commands. The user has already chopped the onion, so now they need to fry it. The previous attempts to use "fry red onion with stove" are not working. Maybe the correct verb is just "fry red onion" without specifying the stove, assuming the user has the necessary tool. Alternatively, the user might need to take the pan from the stove first. But the user hasn't done that yet. Let me check the initial setup again. The stove is in the kitchen, but the user hasn't picked up the pan. So the correct steps would be: take the pan from the stove, then fry the onion. But the user is trying to fry it directly. Maybe the system expects "fry red onion" without the pan part. Let me try that.

Okay, the user is stuck trying to fry the red onion. They've already chopped it, but the game isn't recognizing their commands. Let me think about the possible correct actions. The user has the knife and the onion. The stove is in the kitchen, but they need to use it. Maybe the correct command is to "put the red onion on the stove" and then "fry it". But the user hasn't tried that. Alternatively, maybe the game expects the user to use the stove as the tool. So the next step could be to "fry red onion with stove". But the user has tried that and it's not working. Wait, maybe the correct verb is "cook" instead of "fry". Or "heat the stove" first. But the user is trying to fry directly. Maybe the system requires the user to first take the pan from the stove. Let me check the initial description again. The stove is conventional but empty. The user is in the kitchen with the knife and the onion. So the pan might be on the stove. The correct steps would be: take the pan from the stove, then fry the onion. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to take the pan from the stove. Let me try that.
