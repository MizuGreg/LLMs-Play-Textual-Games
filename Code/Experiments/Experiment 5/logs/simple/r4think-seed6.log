Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, ensure that the antique trunk is open. And then, recover the old key from the antique trunk. With the old key, unlock the wooden door. And then, ensure that the wooden door is open. Then, make an effort to go to the east. After that, ensure that the screen door inside the kitchen is open. After pulling open the screen door, take a trip east. Next, attempt to venture south. After that, pick up the apple from the floor of the garden. After that, travel north. With that accomplished, go west. And then, sit the apple on the stove within the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A typical one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You can make out a closed chest drawer, which looks usual, in the corner. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an antique trunk. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the TextWorld game. They started by opening the antique trunk and taking the old key. Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to use the old key to unlock the wooden door. The user has already done the first two steps, so the next logical action would be to unlock the door.

The current location is the bedroom, and there's a closed wooden door leading east. The user needs to use the old key to unlock it. So the correct command here is "unlock wooden door with old key". But in the game's context, maybe the command is just "unlock wooden door" since the key is already in the inventory. Wait, the previous actions were "open antique trunk" and "take old key from antique trunk", so the key is now in the player's inventory. Therefore, the next step is to unlock the door with that key. The game's commands might require specifying the key, but sometimes it's just the object. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "unlock the wooden door" using the key. So the correct command here is "unlock wooden door". The system message says to only output the action, so the answer should be "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and tried to go east. But when they tried to go east, the game told them they need to open the wooden door first. They tried unlocking it again, but the message said it's already unlocked. Hmm, maybe there's a misunderstanding here.

Wait, the user's last action was "unlock wooden door" again, but the response was "That's unlocked at the moment." So maybe the door is already unlocked, but the game is prompting them to open it? Or maybe the door is locked and they need to unlock it again? But the key was already used to unlock it once. Maybe the door is in a different state? Or perhaps the game is having a glitch?

But according to the original instructions, after unlocking the wooden door, they need to go east. So maybe the user is confused because the game is indicating that the door is already unlocked, but they need to proceed. The next step after unlocking the door is to go east. But the user tried to go east and the game said they need to open the door first. But the door is already unlocked. Maybe the user needs to open it again? Or maybe the door is locked again? Wait, the initial step was to unlock the wooden door with the key. Once unlocked, the door should be open. So maybe the user needs to go east now. But the game is preventing them from doing so because they haven't "opened" the door, even though it's already unlocked. Maybe the game is using different terms: "unlock" vs "open". So perhaps the user needs to "open" the door instead of "unlock" it. But the original instructions said to "unlock the wooden door". So maybe the user should try "open wooden door" instead of "unlock". But the user tried unlocking again, and the game said it's already unlocked. So maybe the correct action now is to go east, even though the game is blocking it. But the user has to follow the game's rules. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to open the door again. But the key was already used once. This is a bit confusing.

Looking back at the original plan: After unlocking the wooden door, go east. Then, ensure the screen door in the kitchen is open, etc. So the next step after unlocking the door is to go east. But the game is preventing that. Maybe the user needs to open the door again. But the key was already used. Wait, maybe the door is locked again after being unlocked. Or maybe the user needs to open the door (as in physically open it) even though it's already unlocked. The game might be using "unlock" and "open" as different actions. So perhaps the user should try "open wooden door" instead of "unlock". But the user's previous action was "unlock wooden door", which worked. Now, the game says the door is unlocked, but the user can't go east. Maybe the user needs to "open" the door again. But the key is already in their inventory. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east regardless. But the game is blocking it. Maybe the user should try "go east" again, even though the game says they need to open the door. But the game's message is conflicting. The user's next action should be to go east, even if the game is blocking it. But the user has to follow the game's instructions. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to open the door again. But the key is already used. Hmm.

Wait, the original instructions said: "With the old key, unlock the wooden door. And then, ensure that the wooden door is open. Then, make an effort to go to the east." So after unlocking, they need to ensure the door is open. Maybe the door is locked again, so they need to unlock it again. But the key was already used. Or maybe the user needs to open the door (as in physically open it) even though it's unlocked. So perhaps the correct action is to "open wooden door" now. But the user tried "unlock" before, and the game said it's already unlocked. So maybe the user should try "open wooden door" now. But the game might not allow that. Alternatively, the user should proceed to go east, even though the game is blocking it. But the user has to follow the game's rules. So maybe the next action is "go east" despite the message. But the user's last action was "unlock wooden door", and the game said it's already unlocked. So the user needs to go east now. The game might be having a glitch, but the user has to proceed. So the next action is "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the game because they tried to go east but the wooden door isn't open. They've already unlocked the door with the old key, but maybe they didn't realize it's already unlocked. The game message says "That's unlocked at the moment," so perhaps the door is open, but the user is trying to go east without checking.

Wait, the previous action was unlocking the door, and the score didn't change again. Maybe the door is open, but the user needs to confirm. The next step should be to go east again, even though the game is prompting them again. The user might be confused because the game is reminding them to open the door first, but it's already unlocked. So the correct action is to go east again, despite the message. The user needs to proceed to the next room.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a sequence of actions in the TextWorld game. Their goal is to eventually win by completing several steps, including opening doors, picking up items, and placing the apple on the stove.

So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and tried to go east. But the game is saying they need to open the wooden door first. Wait, but they just unlocked it. Maybe there's a confusion here. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user tried to go east after unlocking the door, but the game says they have to open the door first. But the door was already unlocked. Maybe the game considers "unlocked" different from "open"? Or maybe there's a step they missed. Let me look at the original instructions again.

The original plan was: after unlocking the wooden door, ensure it's open. Then go east. But perhaps the door is locked but not open, and unlocking it doesn't automatically open it. So maybe they need to open it after unlocking. But the game's message says the door is already unlocked. Hmm.

Wait, the user's last action was "go east", but the game says they have to open the door first. But the door was just unlocked. Maybe the game requires them to open it (like push or pull) after unlocking. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step should be to open the door, then go east. But the user is trying to go east again, which is why the game is blocking them.

So the correct next action should be to open the wooden door (maybe by pushing or pulling), then go east. But the user is trying to go east again, which is why the game is preventing it. Therefore, the next command should be to open the door again, perhaps using the correct verb. But the game might have specific commands. Since the user previously tried to go east and failed, the next step is to open the door first. However, the user already unlocked it. Maybe the game requires them to open it (like a door that's locked but not open) and unlocking is separate from opening. So the user needs to open the door after unlocking. But the game's message says the door is already unlocked. Maybe there's a mistake here, but according to the game's feedback, the user needs to open the door first. So the next action should be to open the wooden door.

The next step in the original instructions was to ensure the screen door inside the kitchen is open. But the current location is the bedroom. So maybe after opening the wooden door, they need to go through it to reach the kitchen. The user's last action was opening the wooden door, so the next logical step would be to go east again, as the door was leading east. But the user might need to check if they're in the right place. Alternatively, maybe they need to look for the screen door in the kitchen. But since the previous attempts to go east didn't work until the door was opened, the next step is probably to go east again after the door is open. The user's next action should be "go east" to proceed to the kitchen area.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game, and they've been following a set of steps to solve the puzzle. The goal is to eventually sit the apple on the stove in the kitchen and win. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, gone east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, and now they're in the kitchen.

The current step in the original instructions was to "attempt to venture south" after opening the screen door. But in the latest move, the user opened the screen door, and now they're in the kitchen. The next logical step would be to go south, as per the original plan. However, looking at the kitchen description, there's an unblocked exit to the north, and the screen door was leading east. The user is now in the kitchen, and the next action should be to go south, but they need to check if that's possible. However, the kitchen's description says the south entrance is unblocked, so they can go south. But the original plan said after opening the screen door, take a trip east, then venture south. Wait, maybe there's a confusion here. Let me check the original instructions again.

Original steps: After pulling open the screen door, take a trip east. Next, attempt to venture south. So after opening the screen door (which is east), they should go east again? But in the kitchen, the screen door is leading east, so maybe after opening it, they need to go east into the garden? But the user just opened the screen door and is now in the kitchen. Wait, maybe the screen door is part of the kitchen's east exit. So after opening the screen door, the next step is to go east, which would take them to the garden. Then, from the garden, venture south. But the user's last action was opening the screen door, and now they're in the kitchen. So the next step should be to go east (to the garden), then from there go south. But the user's current location is the kitchen. So the next action should be to go east, which would take them to the garden. But the original plan said after opening the screen door, take a trip east. So maybe the user is supposed to go east from the kitchen, which is the screen door. Wait, the screen door is closed, but they just opened it. So now, the screen door is open, and they can go east through it. So the next action is to go east. But the user is in the kitchen, and the screen door is leading east. So going east would take them to the garden. Then, from the garden, they need to venture south. But the user's next action should be to go east. However, the user's last action was opening the screen door, and the current location is the kitchen. So the next command should be "go east" to move through the screen door into the garden. Then, from the garden, go south. But the user's current step is in the kitchen, so the next action is "go east". But the user's previous attempt to go east was blocked because the door was closed, but now the screen door is open. So the correct next step is to go east. Therefore, the answer should be "go east".

Okay, the user is in the Garden area. The goal is to pick up the apple from the floor and put it on the stove in the kitchen. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, gone east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, then south to the garden. Now in the garden, they see the apple on the floor.

The next step according to the original plan was to pick up the apple. So the correct action here is to take the apple. The user's previous actions have been following the steps correctly, so taking the apple is the next logical step. Then they need to travel north back to the kitchen and put it on the stove. So the next command should be 'take apple from floor'.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps given in the initial instructions. They've already opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, gone east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden. In the garden, they need to pick up the apple from the floor. But when they tried "take apple from floor", the game said they can't see any such thing. Then they went north back to the backyard, but that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe the apple is in the garden, but the user didn't check the right location. Let me check the garden description again. The garden has a half bag of chips, bell pepper, apple, and shovel on the floor. So the apple is there. The user's previous action was "take apple from floor", but the game said they can't see it. Maybe the command is wrong. Maybe it's "take apple" without specifying the location, or maybe the game requires a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look closer or the apple is hidden. But according to the game's description, the apple is on the floor. So perhaps the correct command is just "take apple". Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to "pick up the apple from the floor of the garden" in the original instructions. So maybe the correct command is "take apple from floor" but the game's parser isn't recognizing it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first look around to find the apple. But the game's description says the apple is on the floor. So perhaps the correct command is "take apple". Let me try that. The user's last action was going north again, so maybe they need to stay in the garden and take the apple. The next step should be to take the apple. But the user tried "take apple from floor" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is just "take apple". Let me check the game's possible commands. The user is in the garden, and the apple is on the floor. So the correct command is "take apple". The previous attempt might have been incorrect because the game might not require the "from floor" part. So the next action should be "take apple".

Fancy seeing you here. Here, by the way, being the backyard. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can make out a set of chairs. The set of chairs is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a bbq. The bbq is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a patio table. The patio table is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user has to follow a series of steps to complete the game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, gone east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, then south to the garden. In the garden, they picked up the apple and now they're back in the backyard again.

The next step according to the original instructions was to travel north after picking up the apple. But the user is now in the backyard again. Wait, the last action was going south from the garden back to the backyard. The current location is the backyard. The next step should be to go north from the backyard to return to the kitchen. But the user's last action was going south, so maybe they need to go north again to get back to the kitchen. However, the original plan was after picking up the apple in the garden, travel north to the backyard, then sit the apple on the stove in the kitchen. But the user is currently in the backyard again. So perhaps the next step is to go north from the backyard to the kitchen, then put the apple on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. Let me check the current state.

In the garden, after picking up the apple, the user went north to the backyard. Then they went south again, which brings them back to the garden. Wait, no, the user's last action was going south from the garden to the backyard. Then the current location is the backyard. The next step should be to go north from the backyard to get back to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, put the apple on the stove. So the correct next action is to go north from the backyard to the kitchen. But the user is currently in the backyard, so the next command should be "go north".

But the current location is the backyard, so the immediate next step is to go north. The user just did that, but the game response shows they're back in the backyard. Maybe there's a loop here. Wait, the last action was go north from the garden, which brought them back to the backyard. Now, the next step is to go north again from the backyard to reach the kitchen. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the score is at 9/19, so maybe they need to go from the backyard north to the kitchen, then put the apple on the stove. But the user's last action was go north, which brought them back to the backyard. So perhaps the correct next step is to go north again from the backyard to the kitchen. But the user might have already done that. Alternatively, maybe they need to go west from the backyard through the screen door back to the kitchen. But the original plan says after picking up the apple, travel north. So maybe the user is stuck in a loop between backyard and garden.

Wait, the current location is the garden, and the exit to the north is the backyard. So the user needs to go north from the garden back to the backyard, then proceed to the kitchen. But the user just tried going north from the backyard and got blocked. Wait, no, the last action was going south to the garden from the backyard. Now they're in the garden again. The exit to the north is the backyard, so going north from the garden would take them back to the backyard. Then from the backyard, they can go west back to the kitchen. Once in the kitchen, they can put the apple on the stove. So the next steps are: go north from garden to backyard, then west to kitchen, then put the apple on the stove. But the user's current location is the garden, so the next command should be 'go north' to get back to the backyard. Then from there, 'go west' to the kitchen. Then 'put apple on stove'.

But right now, the user is back in the backyard, and the last action was going north, which led them back to the backyard. The next step is to go back to the kitchen. Since they have the apple, they need to find the kitchen again. The kitchen was previously accessed via the eastern screen door. So the correct path is to go west from the backyard through the screen door back to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can put the apple on the stove. The user needs to make sure they go west from the backyard to the kitchen and then interact with the stove. The current location is the backyard, so the next command should be to go west.
