I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be great if you could ensure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is open. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer. And then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. And then, make an attempt to go east. And then, open the screen door. After opening the screen door, make an effort to go to the east. Then, take a trip south. And then, retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the bell pepper, head north. Then, travel west. After that, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has followed a set of steps. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and the score has increased each time. The next step in their plan was to ensure the wooden door is open, which they just did by unlocking it. Now they need to attempt to go east.

Wait, the user's next action after unlocking the door should be to go east. But the current prompt says "Do you think you're making the right actions..." so they need to confirm if they're on the right track. The user is asking if they're close to the goal. Since they've unlocked the door, the next logical step is to go through it. But the user might need to check if the door is open, but the game already unlocked it. So the next command should be "go east" to move through the door. The user's previous action was unlocking the door, so the next step is to go east. The answer should be "go east".

You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld. Their goal seems to be to follow a series of steps to retrieve the bell pepper and possibly other items. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far.

Starting in the bedroom, they opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again, then went north to the bathroom, and then back south to the kitchen. The score is at 5/9, so they've completed some steps but not all.

The original goal mentioned was to retrieve the bell pepper from the garden, rest it on the stove, and then go north, west, etc. But so far, the user hasn't reached the garden yet. The current location is the kitchen, and the next steps might involve moving to the garden or finding the bell pepper.

Looking at the kitchen description, there's a note on the kitchen island. Maybe the note has clues. Also, the user needs to go to the garden to get the bell pepper. The screen door is closed east in the kitchen. Earlier, they tried going east from the kitchen but maybe didn't open the screen door yet. Wait, in the previous step, they went east from the kitchen, which led to the bathroom, then back. Maybe the screen door is still closed, so they need to open it to proceed east again.

Alternatively, maybe the garden is accessible through another door. But the current location is the kitchen. The user needs to find the bell pepper in the garden. So perhaps they need to go east from the kitchen through the screen door, then proceed to the garden. Once there, retrieve the bell pepper, then go north, west, etc., as per the original plan.

But the user's last action was going south from the bathroom back to the kitchen. Now, they need to figure out the next step. Since the original plan said after opening the screen door, go east, then take a trip south, retrieve the bell pepper, etc. So maybe the next step is to open the screen door in the kitchen, then go east to the garden. Then retrieve the bell pepper, rest it on the stove, and proceed.

So the next action should be to open the screen door. The user is in the kitchen, and the screen door is closed east. So the command would be "open screen door".

If you're wondering why everything seems so ordinary all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the backyard. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see a set of chairs. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a set of chairs, go to TextWorld. The set of chairs is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You can see a patio table. Now why would someone leave that there? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the original plan, which was to retrieve the bell pepper from the garden floor. But every time they try to take it, it says "You can't see any such thing." Hmm, maybe the bell pepper isn't actually there? Wait, the description of the Garden says there's a half of a bag of chips, an apple, a bell pepper, and a shovel on the floor. So according to that, the bell pepper should be there. But the user is unable to take it. Maybe the command is wrong. The correct command should be "take bell pepper" instead of "take bell pepper from floor"? Because the object is already on the floor, so maybe just "take bell pepper" without specifying the floor. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "take bell pepper from floor" multiple times, but it didn't work. The game's response was "You can't see any such thing." So perhaps the correct command is just "take bell pepper". Let me try that. Alternatively, maybe the bell pepper is hidden or needs to be picked up differently. But according to the game's description, it's on the floor. So the correct action should be to take the bell pepper directly. The user might have been using the wrong command syntax. So the next step is to try "take bell pepper" without the "from floor" part.

You make out a toilet, so there's that. You can see a closed bath. You can make out a sink. The sink is standard. On the sink you can make out a toothbrush.

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a refrigerator. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is ordinary. The stove appears to be empty. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a loop between the Kitchen and Bathroom, going back and forth. The original goal was to retrieve the bell pepper and then rest it on the stove. But the user has been moving around without completing that task.

Wait, the user picked up the bell pepper in the Garden and then went back to the Kitchen. The next step was to go north to the Backyard, but they kept going west and south, looping between rooms. The key step missing is placing the bell pepper on the stove. The stove is in the Kitchen, so the user needs to go to the Kitchen, put the bell pepper there. But the user hasn't done that yet. They kept moving between rooms without addressing the stove. So the next action should be to go to the stove and place the bell pepper there. But the user is currently in the Kitchen, so maybe they need to go to the stove and then put the bell pepper down. But the current prompt says to only output the command. So the correct next step is to go to the stove, but the user is already in the Kitchen. Wait, the stove is in the Kitchen, so maybe the user needs to go to the stove's location. But the user has the bell pepper, so the action is to put it on the stove. But the game might require moving to the stove first. However, in the Kitchen description, the stove is mentioned as being there. So the user should go to the stove and then put the bell pepper down. But the user is in the Kitchen, so the next command should be to go to the stove. But the available commands are to go north, south, east, west. The stove is part of the Kitchen, so maybe the user needs to interact with the stove. But the game's verbs might require "put bell pepper on stove" once the user is near it. However, the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to go to the stove and then put the bell pepper there. But the user is already in the Kitchen. So the correct next step is to go to the stove, but the game might not allow that. Alternatively, the user might need to just put the bell pepper on the stove directly. But the user is in the Kitchen, so the next action is to put the bell pepper on the stove. But the previous attempt to go north was part of the loop. The user needs to focus on the stove in the Kitchen. So the next action should be to put the bell pepper on the stove.
