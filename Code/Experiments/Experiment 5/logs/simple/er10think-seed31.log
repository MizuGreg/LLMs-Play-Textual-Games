You are now playing a life changing game of TextWorld! First stop, open the antique trunk. After pulling open the antique trunk, take the old key from the antique trunk within the bedroom. If you can get your hands on the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. And then, look and see that the wooden door is ajar. After that, try to go east. Then, try to move south. After that, retrieve the lettuce from the couch. And then, try to head north. Then, place the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. An ordinary one.

You can see a closed chest drawer in the corner. You see an antique trunk. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a king-size bed. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game, and they've been trying to unlock a wooden door with an old key. They've already opened the antique trunk, taken the key, and tried to unlock the door. But the game is saying that the door is already unlocked, yet they can't go east. Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here.

Looking back at the steps: The user opened the trunk, got the key, unlocked the door. The game message said "You unlock wooden door" and then the score increased. But then when they tried to go east, the game said they had to open the door first. But the door was already unlocked. Hmm, maybe the door is locked again after being unlocked? Or maybe the game's logic is that unlocking doesn't equate to the door being open. Maybe the key is for a different lock, or perhaps the door is stuck somehow.

Wait, the original instruction said: "After that, look and see that the wooden door is ajar. After that, try to go east." So maybe the user needs to check if the door is actually open. But in the game, after unlocking, the user might need to push or pull it open. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked from the inside, so even though they have the key, they can't open it unless they are on the other side.

Wait, the user is in the bedroom. The wooden door leads east. So when they unlock it, maybe they need to open it manually. But the game's message says "That's unlocked at the moment," which might mean that the key was used, but the door is still closed. So perhaps the next step is to open the door after unlocking it. But the user tried to go east before opening it, which is why the game is prompting them again.

So the correct action would be to open the door after unlocking it. But the game's messages are confusing. The user has the key, unlocked the door, but the door is still closed. So maybe the next step is to open the door. But the game might not have a "open" command. Alternatively, maybe the door is ajar but requires pushing. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check if the door is open before trying to go through.

Alternatively, maybe the game is designed so that after unlocking, the door is automatically open, but the user needs to move through it. But the game is preventing them from going east because the door is still closed. So perhaps the user needs to open the door manually. But the game's commands might not include that. Maybe the user needs to "push" or "pull" the door. But the available commands are limited to the ones the user has used before.

Wait, the user's previous actions were: open the trunk, take the key, unlock the door. Then they tried to go east, but the game said they need to open the door first. But the door was already unlocked. Maybe the game is treating "unlock" as a separate action from "open". So even though the door is unlocked, it's still closed, and the user needs to open it. But how? The game might not have a "open" command. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked from the inside, so the user can't open it unless they are on the other side.

Alternatively, maybe the user is in the bedroom, and the door is locked from the inside. So even though they have the key, they can't open it unless they are outside. But that doesn't make sense. Wait, the original instruction said: "assure that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. And then, look and see that the wooden door is ajar." So maybe after unlocking, the door is ajar, and the user can go through. But the game is not allowing that yet.

So the user's next action should be to go east, but the game is preventing it. But the user has already unlocked the door. Maybe the game is not recognizing that the door is open. So the user needs to try going east again, even though the game says they need to open it first. Maybe the game's message is incorrect, or there's a delay. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the door's state again.

But according to the game's messages, after unlocking, the user tried to go east, and the game said they need to open the door. But the door was already unlocked. So perhaps the correct action is to go east, and the game's message is wrong. But the user is stuck in a loop where they keep getting told they need to open the door, even though they've already unlocked it.

Alternatively, maybe the key is for a different lock. Wait, the original problem said: "After pulling open the antique trunk, take the old key from the antique trunk within the bedroom. If you can get your hands on the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. And then, look and see that the wooden door is ajar." So maybe the key is for the door, but the door is still closed. So the user needs to open the door after unlocking it. But how? Maybe the user needs to push the door open. But the game might not have a "push" command. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked from the inside, so the user needs to open it from the outside.

But the user is in the bedroom, so the door is on the east side. If the door is locked from the inside, the user can't open it. But they have the key. So maybe the key is for the lock, but the door is still closed. So the user needs to open the door, which might require a different action. But the game's available commands are limited to the ones the user has used before.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check if the door is open. But the game's messages are not clear. The user's next action should be to go east, even though the game is preventing it, but according to the original instructions, after unlocking, the door should be ajar. So perhaps the user should try going east again, and the game's message is a mistake.

You are in a kitchen. An usual kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You see a refrigerator. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is standard. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a stove. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Wow! Just like in the movies!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

You see a refrigerator. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is standard. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a stove. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Wow! Just like in the movies!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

You arrive in a bedroom. An ordinary one.

You can see a closed chest drawer in the corner. You see an antique trunk. What a letdown! The antique trunk is empty! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a king-size bed. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game where they need to follow a series of steps to win. The original goal was to retrieve the lettuce from the couch, place it on the stove in the kitchen, and then win. 

Looking at the current state, the user has been moving around the house, unlocking doors, and exploring different rooms. They've gone through the bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, and back again. The score is stuck at 5, which might mean they haven't completed all the required steps yet.

The key steps from the original instructions were:
1. Open the antique trunk and take the old key.
2. Unlock the wooden door with the key.
3. Go east, then south.
4. Retrieve the lettuce from the couch.
5. Place the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen.
6. If done correctly, win.

From the user's actions so far, they've managed to unlock the door, go east to the kitchen, and have been moving between rooms. However, they haven't mentioned retrieving the lettuce from the couch. The couch was mentioned in the initial description of the bedroom, but in the current room (kitchen), there's no mention of a couch. Maybe the user hasn't found the couch yet or hasn't checked the right room.

Wait, the initial description of the bedroom said: "You can see a closed chest drawer in the corner. You see an antique trunk. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a king-size bed. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though." So the couch wasn't mentioned in the bedroom. Maybe the couch is in another room, or perhaps the user needs to check the kitchen island or other areas for the lettuce.

But in the current kitchen description, there's a note on the kitchen island, but no mention of lettuce. The user needs to find the lettuce from the couch. Maybe the couch is in the bedroom, but it's described as having everything taken off. Alternatively, maybe the lettuce is in the kitchen, but the user hasn't looked properly.

The user's next action should be to check the couch for the lettuce. But since they're in the kitchen now, they might need to go back to the bedroom to find the couch. However, the user has been moving between rooms without explicitly searching for items. The original instructions said to "retrieve the lettuce from the couch," so the user needs to find where the couch is and get the lettuce.

But in the current game state, the user is in the kitchen, and the previous rooms don't mention a couch. Maybe the couch is in the bedroom, but it's described as empty. Alternatively, maybe the lettuce is on the kitchen island or somewhere else. The user needs to search carefully.

Since the user hasn't found the lettuce yet, the next step should be to check the couch in the bedroom. But the user is currently in the kitchen. So the correct action would be to go back to the bedroom, check the couch, retrieve the lettuce, then go to the kitchen and place it on the stove. However, the user's current position is the kitchen, so they need to go west back to the bedroom.

But the user has been moving between rooms repeatedly. The next step is to go west to the bedroom, check the couch, get the lettuce, then go to the kitchen and place it on the stove. However, the user hasn't done that yet. The score is at 5, and the original goal requires completing these steps. So the user needs to find the lettuce and place it on the stove to win.

Okay, let's break this down. The user is stuck in a loop between the bedroom and kitchen, trying to find the lettuce. The original goal was to get the lettuce from the couch and place it on the stove. But the user hasn't found the lettuce yet.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the bedroom, but the couch isn't mentioned here. The kitchen has a note on the island, but no lettuce. The user tried looking for the lettuce on the couch in the bedroom but couldn't find it. Maybe the couch is in another room or the lettuce is hidden somewhere else.

The user's actions have been moving between rooms, but they haven't checked the kitchen island properly. The note on the island might be a clue. Maybe the lettuce is on the kitchen island, and the user needs to check there. Alternatively, the couch might be in the kitchen, but the description doesn't mention it. The user needs to check the kitchen again, maybe look under the island or somewhere else.

Since the user is in the bedroom and can't go west, they need to go east back to the kitchen. The next step should be to go east to the kitchen and check the island again for the lettuce. That's the logical next move.

You are in a kitchen. An usual kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You see a refrigerator. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is standard. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a stove. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Wow! Just like in the movies!

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text adventure game where they need to follow specific steps to win. The original goal was to retrieve the lettuce from the couch and place it on the stove in the kitchen. 

From the current state, the user has been moving between the bedroom and kitchen, but they haven't found the lettuce. The bedroom has a king-size bed, but the couch wasn't mentioned there. The kitchen has a note on the kitchen island, but no lettuce. The user tried looking for the lettuce on the couch in the bedroom but couldn't find it.

Maybe the couch is in a different room or the lettuce is hidden somewhere else. The user needs to check all possible locations. Since the kitchen island has a note, maybe the lettuce is there? But the user hasn't checked the kitchen island properly. Alternatively, the couch might be in the kitchen, but the description doesn't mention it.

The user's next step should be to check the kitchen island again for the lettuce. They can go back to the kitchen, check the island, and see if the lettuce is there. If not, maybe they need to look elsewhere. But according to the game's current state, the user is in the bedroom, so they need to go back to the kitchen to check the island.

-= Bathroom =-
You arrive in a bathroom. An usual one.

You make out a toilet. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a closed bath, which looks normal, close by. Hey, want to see a sink? Look over there, a sink. You see a toothbrush on the sink.

There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An usual kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You see a refrigerator. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is standard. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a stove. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Wow! Just like in the movies!

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text adventure game where they need to follow specific steps to win. The original goal was to retrieve the lettuce from the couch and place it on the stove in the kitchen. 

From the current state, the user has been moving between rooms, but they haven't found the lettuce. They ended up in the kitchen again, where there's a note on the kitchen island. The user hasn't found the lettuce yet, and the score is still at 5. The previous attempts to find the lettuce in the garden, backyard, and bedroom didn't work.

Maybe the lettuce is in the kitchen island's note? The user hasn't checked the note yet. Alternatively, the lettuce might be on the stove or counter, but the user hasn't looked there. The next step should be to check the kitchen island's note or look for the lettuce in the kitchen.

From the current state, the user has been moving between rooms, but they haven't found the lettuce. They ended up in the bathroom, which doesn't seem relevant. The user needs to find the lettuce in the kitchen or another room. Since the kitchen is the only place mentioned with the stove, the lettuce might be there. The user should go back to the kitchen and check again.
