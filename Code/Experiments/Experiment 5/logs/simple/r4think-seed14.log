It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First step, doublecheck that the antique trunk in the bedroom is wide open. After that, pick up the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door is open. Then, move east. Then, try to head south. Then, pick up the milk from the couch. Then, make an effort to travel north. Then, put the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a bedroom, but I guess I was wrong.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You can make out a closed antique trunk. Hey, want to see a king-size bed? Look over there, a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. The king-size bed appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps. So far, they've checked the antique trunk in the bedroom, opened it, and found an old key. The next steps according to the original task are to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with the key, then open it, move east, head south, pick up milk from the couch, travel north, put the milk on the stove.

Now, the current location is the bedroom. The next logical step after getting the key is to use it to unlock the wooden door. The user has to make sure the door is unlocked and then open it. So the next action should be to unlock the door with the old key. The command would be "unlock wooden door with old key". But in the game's context, maybe the exact phrasing is different. Let me check the previous actions. The user was told to "make it so that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked with the old key". So the correct command here is to unlock the door using the key. After that, they need to open the door. So the next step is to unlock the door with the key. Then open it. Then move east, etc.

But the user's last action was opening the trunk and getting the key. The next step is to unlock the door. So the next command should be "unlock wooden door with old key". Then, after that, open the door. But the user has to input each command one at a time. So the next action is to unlock the door with the key. Let me make sure that's the correct next step. Yes, that's the next step in the task. So the answer is "unlock wooden door with old key".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've checked the antique trunk, opened it, taken the old key, and tried to unlock the wooden door. But the system message says they need to unlock the door with the key. Wait, the user tried to unlock the door with the key, but the system said they need to take the key first. Then they took the key, and now they have it.

So the next step should be to unlock the wooden door. The user has the key, so the correct action is to unlock the door. Let me check the previous steps again. The user had the key after taking it from the trunk. Then the next action should be to unlock the door. The system message after taking the key says the score increased, so the user is on track. Then the next step is to unlock the door, then open it. After that, move east, then south, pick up milk, etc. So the next command should be unlock wooden door with old key. But the user already has the key, so that's the next step.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen.

You see a refrigerator. You make out a counter. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can see a stove. The stove is ordinary. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. This always happens! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user has to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door in the bedroom, then moved east to the kitchen. The next step in the original task was to "try to head south" after moving east. But in the kitchen, the exits are: a closed screen door east, open wooden door west, unguarded exit north, and exit south. Wait, the user is in the kitchen now. The next action according to the task is to try to head south. But the kitchen has an exit to the south. So the next command should be "go south". But I need to check if that's the correct next step. The user's score is at 5/8, and the next steps in the original instructions were after moving east, try to head south, then pick up the milk from the couch, then travel north, then put the milk on the stove. Wait, but in the kitchen, the couch isn't mentioned. Wait, maybe the couch is in another room. Wait, the user moved east from the bedroom to the kitchen. The original task said after moving east, try to head south. So in the kitchen, the user should try to go south. But the kitchen's south exit is unblocked. So the next action is "go south". But the user is in the kitchen now. Let me check the current location. The user is in the kitchen, and the next step is to go south. So the correct command is "go south".

-= Living Room =-
You find yourself in a living room. A normal one.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a couch. On the couch you can make out a milk. You make out a low table. On the low table you make out a remote. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a tv. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user has to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've checked the antique trunk, opened it, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door in the bedroom, then went east to the kitchen, south to the living room. The next steps according to the original task are: pick up the milk from the couch, then put it on the stove.

In the Living Room, the user sees a couch with a milk on it. The next action should be to pick up the milk. The user's last action was 'go south', which led them to the living room. Now, they need to pick up the milk from the couch. So the next command should be 'take milk from couch' or something similar. But in the game's context, the correct command might be 'take milk' if the milk is on the couch. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "pick up the milk from the couch" so the exact command would be 'take milk from couch'. But the system might accept 'take milk' if the game interprets it that way. However, the user's previous actions were very specific, like 'unlock wooden door with old key', so maybe they need to be precise. But in the current room, the milk is on the couch, so the correct command is 'take milk from couch'. However, the user's next action after arriving in the living room is to pick up the milk. So the next command should be 'take milk from couch'. But the user's last input was 'go south', and the system's response is the living room description. So the next step is to take the milk. Therefore, the correct command is 'take milk from couch'.

In the current location, which is the Living Room, the user just took the milk. The next action should be to go north, as per the instructions. The Living Room has an exit to the north that's unblocked. So the correct command here is "go north". Once they go north, they'll reach the next room, probably the kitchen again or another area, and then they can proceed to put the milk on the stove. Let me make sure there's no other step missed. The user has to go north from the Living Room, so "go north" is the next command.
