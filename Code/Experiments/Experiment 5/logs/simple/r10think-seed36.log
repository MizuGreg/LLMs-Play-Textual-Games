Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to ensure that the chest drawer is open. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. Then, make it so that the wooden door is ajar. And then, attempt to go to the east. Then, open the screen door. And then, travel east. With that done, make an effort to travel south. And then, retrieve the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. Then, make an attempt to move north. With that accomplished, head west. With that done, place the half of a bag of chips on the stove. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You've seen better bedrooms, but at least this one seems pretty normal.

You see a chest drawer. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. A closed antique trunk is nearby. You can make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and tried to make the door ajar. But the system is not recognizing "ajar" as a verb. The user is confused and wants to know if they're on the right track.

First, I need to recall the game's current state. The wooden door was just unlocked, and the next step was to make it ajar. The user tried "ajar wooden door" but got an error. The correct action here is probably to use "open" instead of "ajar" since "open" is a common verb for doors. The system might not accept "ajar" as a valid command here.

The user's score is at 3/4, so they're close. The next steps after unlocking the door would be to open it (since it's unlocked but maybe not open yet), then go east. The user mentioned trying to go east after opening the door. So the next action should be "open wooden door" to make it ajar. Then proceed to go east.

But the user tried "ajar" and it didn't work. So the correct command is "open wooden door". Then, after that, they can go east. The user might have missed using "open" instead of "ajar". So the next step is to open the door, then go east as instructed.

But the thing is empty. You make out a stove. But the thing is empty. Look over there! a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you make out a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. Then they went east into the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, there's a screen door leading east that's closed. The user tried to go east but was told they need to open the screen door first.

The next step according to the original instructions was to "open the screen door." The user has already reached the kitchen, so the next logical action is to open the screen door. The user's previous attempt to go east was blocked because the screen door was closed. So the correct action here is to open the screen door first. Then, after opening it, they can proceed east again. The user's score is at 5/7, so they need to continue following the steps correctly. The key is to make sure each action is done in the right order, addressing the current obstacle (opening the screen door) before moving on.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. They started in the Bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and then tried to make the door ajar. But the system kept rejecting "ajar" and "unlock" commands, so they eventually just "open wooden door" which worked.

Now, they moved to the Kitchen, opened the screen door, went east to the Backyard. The next step was to go south, as the Backyard's description says "You should try going south." The user's last action was "go east" which led them to the Backyard. Now, the next logical step would be to go south from the Backyard. The user needs to check if that's the correct direction. The goal was to retrieve the half bag of chips from the garden, so maybe the garden is south of the Backyard. The user should try "go south" next.

Okay, let's see. The user's goal is to retrieve the half of a bag of chips from the garden. The current location is the Garden, and the items there include the half bag of chips. The user needs to pick it up.

Looking at the previous actions, they've been moving through different rooms, opening doors, and now they're in the Garden. The prompt mentions that the half of a bag of chips is on the floor. So the next logical step is to take that item. The command should be "take half of a bag of chips" or something similar. But the game might expect a specific phrasing. Let me check the previous interactions. The user said "retrieve the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden." So maybe the exact command is "take half of a bag of chips" or "take the half of a bag of chips."

Wait, in the game's context, the correct command would be "take half of a bag of chips" since that's what's on the floor. The user has to interact with the item directly. So the next action should be to take it. Then, after taking it, they might need to move north, as per the previous instructions. But the current step is to take the item. So the correct command here is "take half of a bag of chips."

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in the text-based game. Their goal was to eventually reach the original goal, which I assume is something like completing the game or achieving a certain objective.

So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden. In the garden, they took the half of a bag of chips. Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to "make an effort to move north" after retrieving the chips, then head west, and place the chips on the stove.

Looking at the current location, the user is in the Garden. The next action should be to move north. The user's last action was taking the chips, so the next command should be "go north". That's the logical next step after retrieving the half of a bag of chips. Then, after moving north, they need to go west and place the chips on the stove. But right now, the immediate next step is to go north from the garden. The user has to navigate through the areas as per the instructions. So the correct command here is "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in the text-based game. Their goal was to open the chest drawer, take the key, unlock the door, open the screen door, go east, then south, retrieve the half-bag of chips, and place it on the stove.

So far, they've done most of the steps. They took the half-bag of chips in the garden and went north back to the backyard. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to place the chips on the stove. But the current location is the garden, and the stove is in the kitchen. Wait, the user is in the garden now. The previous step was going north from the garden to the backyard. Now, they need to get back to the kitchen where the stove is. 

Looking at the current environment in the garden, the user is told there's a tomato plant, milk, and a shovel on the floor. The previous step was going north, which led them back to the backyard. But the user needs to get to the kitchen. The path from the garden to the kitchen would be through the backyard, then maybe through the kitchen. But the user is currently in the garden. The next logical step would be to go south from the garden to get back to the backyard, then find a way to the kitchen. However, the user's last action was going north, which brought them to the backyard. Now, they need to go south again to return to the garden. Wait, but the user is in the garden now. The original plan was to place the chips on the stove, which is in the kitchen. So they need to go from the garden to the kitchen. The path would be garden -> backyard (south) -> kitchen (east or west?).

Wait, in the backyard, there's a screen door leading west to the kitchen. So from the garden, going south would take them to the backyard, then through the screen door west to the kitchen. But the user is in the garden, and the current location is the garden. The user has the half-bag of chips. The next step is to go south to the backyard, then west through the screen door to the kitchen, then place the chips on the stove. But the user's last action was going north from the garden to the backyard. Now, they need to go south back to the garden, but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe the user is in the garden, and the next step is to go north again to the backyard, then west through the screen door to the kitchen. But the user is in the garden, so the correct direction would be south to get to the backyard. Wait, the garden's description says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north." So from the garden, going north leads to the backyard. Then, from the backyard, going west leads to the kitchen. So the user needs to go north from the garden to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. But the user is currently in the garden. The next action should be to go north to the backyard. Then, in the backyard, go west through the screen door to the kitchen. Once in the kitchen, place the chips on the stove. So the next command should be "go north" from the garden to the backyard.

So far, they've managed to open the chest drawer, take the old key, unlock the wooden door, and navigate through the kitchen, backyard, and garden. They've picked up the half bag of chips in the garden. Now, they're in the backyard again, and the next step according to the original instructions was to place the half of a bag of chips on the stove. But the current location is the backyard, and the stove is in the kitchen. 

Wait, the user is in the backyard, and the stove is in the kitchen. So they need to go back to the kitchen. The current room is the backyard, which has a screen door leading west back to the kitchen. The user has the half bag of chips, so they need to go back to the kitchen, then to the stove. But the previous steps showed that after the garden, they went back and forth between backyard and garden. 

Looking at the last interaction, the user is in the backyard again, and the next action should be to go back to the kitchen (west through the screen door), then go north to the kitchen, then find the stove and place the chips there. But the user hasn't yet reached the kitchen. So the next logical step is to go west through the screen door to return to the kitchen. 

But the user's last action was "go north" which led them back to the backyard. So the correct next step is to go west through the screen door to get back to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can go north to the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to go west through the screen door. However, in the current prompt, the user is in the backyard, and the screen door is open leading west. So the correct command is "go west" or "go through screen door". But the game might require the exact command. Looking at previous interactions, the user used "go east" and "go west" commands. So the next step is to go west to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, go north to the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is "go west".

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a refrigerator. You can make out a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But the thing is empty. You make out a stove. But the thing is empty. Look over there! a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you make out a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Bedroom =-
You've seen better bedrooms, but at least this one seems pretty normal.

You see a chest drawer. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? A closed antique trunk is nearby. You can make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But the thing is empty.

There is an open wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in the TextWorld game. Their goal was to open the chest drawer, take the key, unlock the door, open the screen door, go east, then south, retrieve the chips, and place them on the stove. 

So far, they've managed to get to the Garden, took the half bag of chips, and tried going back and forth between the Garden, Backyard, Kitchen, and Bedroom. The current location is the Bedroom again, with the chest drawer and the open wooden door east.

The next step mentioned in the original plan was to "place the half of a bag of chips on the stove." But the user is now in the Bedroom, and the stove is in the Kitchen. So they need to get back to the Kitchen. The current location is the Bedroom, and the open door east leads back to the Kitchen. 

Wait, in the previous steps, after going west from the Kitchen, they ended up in the Bedroom. Now, the open door east from the Bedroom would lead back to the Kitchen. So the next logical step is to go east from the Bedroom to the Kitchen again. Then, they can proceed to the stove and place the chips there. 

But the user's last action was "go west" which brought them back to the Bedroom. Now, they need to go east again to return to the Kitchen. Once there, they can go north to the stove. But the user's next action should be "go east" to reach the Kitchen again. Then, from the Kitchen, they can go north to the stove. However, the user's current position is the Bedroom, so the immediate next action is to go east to the Kitchen. 

Therefore, the correct next command is "go east" to return to the Kitchen and proceed to the stove.

So far, they've managed to open the chest drawer, take the old key, unlock the wooden door, and navigate through the kitchen, backyard, garden, and even the bathroom. They've picked up the half-bag of chips in the garden. The next step mentioned in the original instructions was to "place the half of a bag of chips on the stove." 

Looking at the current location, the user is in the bathroom. The previous step was going north from the kitchen to the bathroom. The next logical step would be to find the stove, which they mentioned in the kitchen description. But the user is now in the bathroom. Wait, maybe they need to go back to the kitchen or another room where the stove is located. 

Wait, in the kitchen description, there's a stove mentioned. So perhaps the user needs to go back to the kitchen. But the current location is the bathroom, which has an exit to the south (back to the kitchen). So the next action should be to go south back to the kitchen, then proceed to the stove. But the user's last action was going north to the bathroom. So the next step would be to go south back to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can go to the stove and place the chips there. 

But the user's last input was "go north" leading to the bathroom. Now, the assistant needs to tell them to go south back to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, they can go to the stove. However, the user's current location is the bathroom, so the next command should be "go south" to return to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, they can go to the stove. But the user hasn't mentioned the stove yet. So the correct next action is to go south back to the kitchen. 

Alternatively, maybe the stove is in another room, but according to the previous descriptions, the stove is in the kitchen. So the user needs to go back to the kitchen. Therefore, the next command should be "go south" to return to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, they can proceed to the stove. But the user is currently in the bathroom, so the immediate next step is to go south.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this TextWorld game. Their goal is to complete a set of tasks, starting from opening the chest drawer, taking the key, unlocking the door, and so on. So far, they've managed to get to the bathroom, but they're stuck in a loop between the kitchen and bathroom.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the bathroom, and the only exit is south back to the kitchen. The previous actions involved moving north and south between these rooms. The user's last action was "go north" which led them back to the bathroom. Now, they need to find a way to proceed further.

The original goal mentioned retrieving the half bag of chips from the garden and placing it on the stove. The user has already taken the half bag of chips from the garden and is now back in the kitchen. But they're stuck in a loop between the kitchen and bathroom. The next logical step would be to check the kitchen island where a note was mentioned earlier. Maybe the note has instructions or clues on what to do next. Alternatively, they might need to look for the stove mentioned in the kitchen description and place the chips there.

But the user's last action was "go north" again, which didn't help. So, perhaps they need to check the kitchen island for the note. The note might indicate that they need to put the half bag of chips on the stove. Since they have the chips, they should go to the stove and do that. However, the current location is the bathroom, so they need to go back to the kitchen first. Then, go to the kitchen island, find the note, and follow its instructions. Alternatively, maybe the note is already there and tells them to put the chips on the stove.

Wait, the user has the half bag of chips. They need to place it on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen. So the steps would be: go from bathroom south to kitchen, then go to the stove, and put the chips there. But the user is currently in the bathroom, so the next action should be "go south" back to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, go to the stove location. But the kitchen description mentions the stove is empty. So maybe the user needs to go to the stove and put the chips there. However, the user hasn't interacted with the stove yet. So the correct next step is to go back to the kitchen, then go to the stove, and put the chips on it. But the user's current position is the bathroom, so the immediate next action is "go south" to the kitchen.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. Their goal seems to be to complete a set of tasks, like opening drawers, finding keys, unlocking doors, and eventually retrieving the half-bag of chips and placing it on the stove.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Kitchen again, having cycled through several rooms. The score is at 9/23, which suggests they've completed most of the initial tasks but might be stuck in a loop. The last action was "go south," which brought them back to the Kitchen. The note in the Kitchen mentions a note on the kitchen island, which might be important. The user has already taken the half-bag of chips from the Garden, so the next step should be placing it on the stove. However, the stove is in the Kitchen, so they need to go there. But the current location is the Kitchen, so maybe they need to interact with the stove. The user has the half-bag of chips in their inventory, so the next logical step is to put it on the stove. The command should be "put half of a bag of chips on stove." But the system might require a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe they need to go to the stove first. But since they're already in the Kitchen, the direct action is to place the item on the stove. Let me check the previous steps. The user took the chips from the Garden and is now in the Kitchen. The stove is mentioned in the Kitchen description. So the correct action is to put the chips on the stove.
