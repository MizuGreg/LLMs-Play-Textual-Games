Welcome to another exciting round of TextWorld! First of all, ensure that the antique trunk is open. After opening the antique trunk, take the old key from the antique trunk. And then, unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with the old key. And then, open the wooden door. Then, make an attempt to travel east. Okay, and then, doublecheck that the refrigerator is wide open. Once you have opened the refrigerator, take the bell pepper from the refrigerator. After that, rest the bell pepper on the stove inside the kitchen. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a bedroom.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a chest drawer. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You see an antique trunk. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.
