You are now playing a profound session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, ensure that the antique trunk is open. And then, recover the old key from the antique trunk in the bedroom. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. Then, open the wooden door. And then, move east. And then, make absolutely sure that the screen door is open. Having opened the screen door, attempt to head east. With that done, move south. Then, retrieve the apple from the floor of the garden. And then, make an attempt to venture north. If you can succeed at that, head west. With that accomplished, sit the apple on the stove inside the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in a bedroom.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a chest drawer, so there's that. You make out a closed antique trunk in the corner. You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You make out a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you see a note.

Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, there's a screen door leading east, a wooden door west, and exits to north and south.

The next step according to the original plan was to make sure the screen door is open. The user mentioned that after opening the screen door, they should try to go east again. But in the current scene, the screen door is closed. So the first thing needed is to open the screen door. Once that's done, they can attempt to go east again. Then, after that, they need to move south, retrieve the apple from the garden, venture north, go west, and put the apple on the stove in the kitchen. But right now, the immediate next step is to open the screen door.

Wait, the user's last action was going east to the kitchen. The current description says there's a closed screen door east. So the next action should be to open that screen door. Then, after opening it, they can try to go east again. So the correct command here is "open screen door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the original instructions. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. Then they opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, and now they're in the garden.

The current goal is to retrieve the apple from the floor of the garden. The user has already reached the garden (step 8/9), and the next step according to the original plan was to "retrieve the apple from the floor of the garden." So the next action should be to pick up the apple. The user has to use the command "take apple from floor" or something similar. But in the game's context, the correct command would be "take apple" since it's on the floor. Let me check the previous actions. Earlier, they took the old key from the trunk, so "take" is the correct verb here. Therefore, the next action is to take the apple from the floor. The user is at 8/9, so after taking the apple, they would proceed to the next step, which is "attempt to venture north." But since the user has to input the next command, the correct action now is to take the apple.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps in the TextWorld game. They've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, and then went south to the garden. In the garden, they tried to take the apple from the floor but couldn't.

Wait, the prompt says there's an apple on the floor in the garden. The user's last action was "take apple from floor", but the game responded that they can't see any such thing. Maybe the apple isn't directly on the floor? Let me check the description again. The garden has a lettuce, tomato plant, apple, and shovel on the floor. So the apple is indeed there. Maybe the correct command is just "take apple" without specifying "from floor"? Or perhaps "pick up apple"?

But the game's previous interactions show that when the user took the old key from the trunk, they used "take old key from antique trunk". So maybe the correct syntax here is "take apple from floor". But the game said "can't see any such thing". Maybe the apple is not on the floor but somewhere else? Wait, the description says "on the floor", so that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first check the floor, but in TextWorld, sometimes you have to use the correct verb. Maybe "get apple" or "pick up apple" is the right command. But the user tried "take apple from floor" and it didn't work. So perhaps the correct action is just "take apple" without specifying the location. Let me think. In previous steps, when the user took the key, they had to specify "from antique trunk". But maybe in this case, since the apple is on the floor, the correct command is "take apple from floor". But the game said it's not there. Maybe the apple is not on the floor but in a different location? Wait, the description says "on the floor", so that's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look around more. But the game's prompt says "there is a lettuce, a tomato plant, an apple and a shovel on the floor". So the apple is there. Maybe the correct command is "take apple" without the "from floor" part. Let me check previous commands. The user tried "take apple from floor" and it failed. So maybe the correct command is just "take apple". Let's try that. If the game allows that, then the user can pick it up. Otherwise, maybe the user needs to use "get apple" or "pick up apple". But according to the game's previous responses, when the user took the key, they had to specify "from antique trunk". So perhaps the correct command here is "take apple from floor". But the game said it's not there. Maybe the apple is not on the floor but in a different location. Wait, the description says "on the floor", so that's confusing. Maybe the user needs to check again. Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting a different command. Since the user is close to the goal, the next step is to take the apple, then go north, then west, then put it on the stove. So even if the command fails, maybe the user should try again. But the user's last action was "take apple from floor", which failed. So the next possible action is to try "take apple" without the "from floor" part. Let's go with that.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've reached a certain point. The goal is to follow a series of steps to win. Let me recap the current situation.

The user just went north from the Garden back to the Backyard. The next step in the original instructions was to "sit the apple on the stove inside the kitchen." But the user is now in the Backyard. Wait, the apple was picked up in the Garden, so they need to get back to the kitchen. 

Looking at the current location: Backyard. The exits here are west (screen door) and south (exit). The user needs to get back to the kitchen. Previously, they came from the Kitchen to the Backyard via the screen door. So maybe the way back is through the screen door west to get back to the Kitchen. Then, once in the Kitchen, they can sit the apple on the stove. 

But the user's last action was going north from the Garden to the Backyard. Now, they need to find the path back to the Kitchen. The Backyard has a screen door leading west, which was open earlier. So the next step should be to go west through the screen door back to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, they can proceed to sit the apple on the stove. 

Wait, but in the Kitchen, the user had previously opened the screen door and moved east to the Backyard. Now, they need to go back west to the Kitchen. Once back in the Kitchen, the next step is to sit the apple on the stove. The original instructions said to "sit the apple on the stove inside the kitchen" after moving east and then west. So once in the Kitchen, the apple is already picked up, so the action would be to sit it on the stove. 

But the user is currently in the Backyard. So the next command should be to go west through the screen door back to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, they can perform the final action. So the correct next step is to go west.
