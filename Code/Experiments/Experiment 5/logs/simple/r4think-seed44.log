Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to doublecheck that the antique trunk is opened. Then, recover the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. Having taken the old key, insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it. After that, look and see that the wooden door is ajar. And then, travel east. With that over with, ensure that the screen door is open. And then, attempt to move east. After that, make an attempt to go south. With that accomplished, lift the apple from the floor of the garden. After that, make an attempt to take a trip north. Then, go to the west. With that over with, put the apple on the stove. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

You find yourself in a bedroom. An ordinary one.

Oh, great. Here's a chest drawer. You make out an antique trunk. Huh, weird. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been following the instructions to open the antique trunk, take the old key, and use it to unlock the wooden door. So far, they've managed to open the trunk, take the key, and insert it into the door's lock. The next step was to unlock the door, but the user might have missed that part.

Looking at the current state, the wooden door is still closed. The user's last action was inserting the key into the lock, but they didn't actually unlock it. The game's feedback after inserting the key might not have been explicit, so the user might not have realized the door is now unlocked. The next logical step would be to attempt to open the door. The user needs to try to unlock it by using the key. After that, they can proceed east as instructed. The user might need to try opening the door again, but since the key was used, it should work now. So the next action should be to open the wooden door.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been trying to follow the steps given. The original goal was to open the antique trunk, get the old key, use it to unlock the wooden door, then proceed east, etc. 

So far, the user has opened the antique trunk and taken the old key. Then they tried to insert the key into the wooden door lock, but the game responded that they need to unlock the door first. Wait, the user tried to insert the key into the wooden door lock, but the game says they have to unlock the door with the key first. Hmm, maybe the key is for the lock on the door, so inserting it into the lock is the first step to unlock it.

But the user's next action was to "open wooden door", which the game corrected by saying they need to unlock it first. So the correct action here is to use the old key to unlock the door. But the user already has the key. So the next step should be to unlock the door with the key. However, in the game's response, it's saying that the user has to unlock the door first, which might mean that the key is already in the lock, and they need to use it to open the door.

Wait, the user's previous action was inserting the key into the lock. The game's response was that they need to unlock the door first. So maybe the next step is to use the key to unlock the door. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct action here is to "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But the game's response says that the user has to unlock the door first, which might mean that the key is already in the lock, and they need to proceed to open it.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "open wooden door" after inserting the key. But the game's message says that they have to unlock it first. So perhaps the correct action is to "unlock wooden door" using the key. But the user's last action was "insert old key into wooden door lock", which might have been the correct step. Then the next step would be to "unlock wooden door" or "open wooden door".

But the game's response says that the user has to unlock the door first, which might mean that the key is in the lock, and they need to use it to open the door. So the next action should be to "unlock wooden door" or "open wooden door". However, the user's last action was "insert old key into wooden door lock", which might have been the correct step. Then the game's response is indicating that the door is closed, and they need to unlock it. So the next step is to use the key to unlock the door.

So the correct next action is to "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But the game's response says that the user has to unlock the door first, which might mean that the key is already in the lock, and they need to proceed to open it. Therefore, the next action should be to "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the instructions in the TextWorld game. They started by opening the antique trunk, taking the old key, and then trying to insert it into the wooden door lock. The system corrected them, saying they need to unlock the door first. Then they tried unlocking it, which worked, and then they tried going east, but the system said they need to open the door first.

Wait, the user just tried "go east" but the system said they have to open the wooden door first. So the next step should be to open the door again. But earlier, they already unlocked it. Maybe the door is locked again? Or maybe "unlock" and "open" are different actions here. Let me check the previous steps.

The user inserted the key into the lock and then unlocked the door. After that, when they tried to go east, the system said they need to open the door. So perhaps "unlock" is different from "open". Maybe the door is locked, and they need to open it after unlocking. But in the previous step, they unlocked it, so maybe the door is now unlocked but not open? Or maybe the system is confused. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to "open" the door after unlocking. So the user should try "open wooden door" again. But the system might have a specific command. Let me check the history.

The user tried "unlock wooden door" and it worked. Then they tried "go east" and the system said they need to open the door. So the next step is to open the door. So the correct action is "open wooden door". But the user might have already done that. Wait, no. The user had the key, unlocked the door, but maybe the door is still closed. So they need to open it. So the next action should be "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've been following a set of steps to progress. The original goal was to recover the old key, unlock the door, move east, then go to the garden, pick up the apple, put it on the stove, and then stop. 

So far, the user has opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, inserted it into the door lock, unlocked the door, opened the wooden door, went east to the kitchen, then went north to the bathroom. The current location is the bathroom, and the next step mentioned was to go south to return to the kitchen. But the user is now at the bathroom, and the next action is to go south.

Wait, the original plan after the bathroom was to go south back to the kitchen. But the user's last action was going north to the bathroom. Now, they need to go south to get back to the kitchen. However, the user's next action is to go south, which would take them back to the kitchen. But the user's score is at 5/10, and the original goal was to reach the garden, pick up the apple, etc. 

But the user might be getting confused. Let me check the steps again. The initial steps were: open trunk, take key, unlock door, go east to kitchen, then go north to bathroom. But the original plan after the kitchen was to go east through the screen door, then move east again, then south to the garden. But the user is now in the bathroom, so going south would take them back to the kitchen. 

Wait, maybe the user is on the wrong path. The original plan was after unlocking the door and going east to the kitchen, then attempting to move east again through the screen door. But in the kitchen, there's a screen door leading east. So after the kitchen, the user should go east through the screen door to reach the garden. However, the user went north to the bathroom instead. So now, they need to go back south to the kitchen, then east through the screen door to the garden. 

But the user is at the bathroom, so the next logical step is to go south back to the kitchen. Then from the kitchen, go east through the screen door to the garden. Then proceed with the apple task. 

So the current action is to go south from the bathroom to the kitchen. The user's next command should be "go south" to return to the kitchen. Then from there, go east to the garden. 

But the user's last action was "go north" to the bathroom, and now they need to go south back. So the correct next step is "go south".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've been following a series of steps to progress. The original goal mentioned was to eventually lift the apple from the garden and put it on the stove. So far, the user has navigated through the bedroom, unlocked the door, went east to the kitchen, then north to the bathroom, and back to the kitchen.

Looking at the current location, which is the kitchen again. The user's score is at 5/11. The next steps mentioned in the original instructions were to lift the apple from the garden, then go north, west, etc., and put the apple on the stove. But currently, the user is in the kitchen, and the kitchen has a note on the island. The stove is empty, and there's a screen door east and a west door leading back.

The user needs to find the garden where the apple is. Since the kitchen is part of the house, maybe the garden is outside. The screen door leading east is closed. The user has been told to ensure the screen door is open before moving east. But in the previous steps, after unlocking the door, they went east to the kitchen. Now, maybe the garden is beyond the screen door. So the next logical step would be to open the screen door east, then go east to enter the garden. Once there, they can lift the apple and return to the stove.

But the user's last action was going south from the bathroom back to the kitchen. Now, the next action should be to open the screen door east. However, the user might not have done that yet. The original instructions said to ensure the screen door is open before moving east. So the correct next step is to open the screen door, then go east to the garden. Then, lift the apple and proceed to the stove. But according to the current state, the screen door is closed. So the user needs to open it first.

The original goal mentioned in the welcome message was to lift the apple from the garden, put it on the stove, and then proceed north, west, etc. But so far, the user has only reached the kitchen. The current location is the kitchen, and the screen door is open. The next step might be to check the kitchen island where there's a note.

However, the user's previous action was opening the screen door, so maybe they need to move east now. But the game might have different exits. Let me check the previous steps again.

Wait, in the kitchen, the screen door is leading east, and there's an open wooden door west. The user just opened the screen door, so maybe they need to go east. But the user's last command was "open screen door", and the response was that they opened it. Now, the next action should be to go east. But the user might need to check if there's anything else in the kitchen first. However, the original goal includes going to the garden, so maybe the user needs to go east through the screen door to reach the garden. But the user's current location is the kitchen, and the screen door is open. So the next step is to go east. But the user's previous action was opening the screen door, so the next command should be "go east". But the user might have to check if that's the correct move. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for the apple in the garden. But the user hasn't reached the garden yet. So the next step is to go east through the screen door. Therefore, the correct command is "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game as instructed. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked the door, and then moved east to the kitchen. Then they went north to the bathroom, south back to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, and then south to the garden.

Now, in the garden, the prompt says there's a tomato plant, milk, an apple, and a shovel on the floor. The user's next step was to lift the apple from the floor. The original goal mentioned putting the apple on the stove. So, the next action should be to take the apple. Then, after taking it, they need to go north to the kitchen where the stove is. But the current location is the garden, so the immediate next step is to pick up the apple. The user's last action was "go south", which brought them to the garden. Now, they need to pick up the apple. The correct command here is "take apple".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game as instructed. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked the door, and then went east to the kitchen. Then they moved through the bathroom, back to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, and then south to the garden. In the garden, they took the apple.

Now, the next step according to the original plan was to "put the apple on the stove." But the user is in the garden, and the stove is in the kitchen. So they need to go back to the kitchen. Let me check the current location: the garden. The garden has a tomato plant, milk, apple, and shovel. The user has the apple. The next step is to go north to return to the kitchen. Once there, they can put the apple on the stove. But the current prompt says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north." So the correct next action is to go north to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, they can put the apple on the stove. So the next command should be "go north".

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. A normal kind of place.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a set of chairs. The set of chairs is usual. But the thing is empty. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a bbq. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You can make out a patio table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The patio table is typical. The patio table appears to be empty.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been following the instructions to complete various tasks. The current goal is to put the apple on the stove. So far, they've collected the apple in the garden and are now back in the backyard. The next step mentioned in the original instructions was to "put the apple on the stove." 

But wait, the user is in the backyard now. The stove was in the kitchen, right? So they need to go back to the kitchen. The backyard has an open screen door leading west, which would take them back to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can go north to the stove. But the user just came from the garden, went north to the backyard, and now they're back in the backyard. So the next logical step is to go west through the screen door back to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, they can go north to the stove. But the user hasn't mentioned going back to the kitchen yet. The current location is the backyard, so the immediate next action should be to go west to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, go north to the stove. But the user's last action was "go north" from the garden, which took them to the backyard. Now, they need to go west to the kitchen. So the correct next command is "go west" to return to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, they can go north to the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to go west from the backyard to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, go north to the stove. But the user is currently in the backyard, so the next action is "go west".
</think>go west

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a refrigerator. You make out a counter. The counter is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You can see a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.
