I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, open the antique trunk. And then, retrieve the old key from the antique trunk. With the old key, unlock the wooden door inside the bedroom with the old key. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. And then, head east. After that, ensure that the screen door is open. And then, head east. And then, try to move south. And then, pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. With the bell pepper, attempt to head north. With that accomplished, go to the west. And then, place the bell pepper on the stove. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
Ah, the bedroom. This is some kind of bedroom, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can make out a closed chest drawer in the room. You can see a closed antique trunk nearby. You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld. Their task is to follow a series of steps to complete a quest. So far, they've opened an antique trunk and retrieved an old key. But the system gave an error saying "That's not a verb I recognise." Wait, maybe the user tried to "retrieve" the key, but the correct command is "take" or "get"?

Looking back at the previous interaction: the user said "retrieve the old key from the antique trunk", and the system responded with an error. So the system doesn't recognize "retrieve" as a valid verb. In text adventures, common verbs are "take", "get", "open", "use", etc. So the correct action here would be "take the old key" or "get the old key".

The user's next step after retrieving the key is to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with the old key. So after getting the key, they need to use it on the door. The next steps in the original task are: unlock the wooden door, ensure it's open, head east, open the screen door, head east again, move south, pick up the bell pepper, use it to head north, go west, and place the bell pepper on the stove.

But first, the user needs to correctly take the key. Since "retrieve" isn't a valid command, the correct action is "take" or "get". Let me check the game's possible commands. In many text adventures, "take" is the standard verb for picking up items. So the user should use "take the old key" next.

After that, they can use the key to unlock the door. The door is described as closed and leading east. So the next steps would be to use the key on the door, then open it. Then move east, etc.

So the correct next action is to take the key. The user's previous attempt was to "retrieve", which the system didn't recognize. So the answer should be "take the old key".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a set of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, retrieved the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and now they need to ensure the door is open. The system tried "ensure that the wooden door is open" but it's not a valid command.

Hmm, the user is confused because they think they need to check if the door is open. But in TextWorld, commands are usually verbs that the game recognizes. Since the door was just unlocked, maybe the next step is to move east. The original task said after unlocking the door, ensure it's open, then head east. But "ensure" isn't a valid verb here. So the correct action would be to "go east" instead. The user might have misinterpreted the instruction, thinking they need to check the door's state, but actually, after unlocking, they should just move through the door. So the next command should be "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, retrieved the old key, unlocked the wooden door, but then tried to go east without ensuring the door was open. The game responded that they need to open the door first.

Wait, the user tried "ensure that the wooden door is open" but that wasn't a valid command. Then they tried "go east" but the game said they have to open the door first. So the next step should be to make sure the door is open. But how? The door was already unlocked. Maybe the door is locked even though it's unlocked? Or maybe "unlock" and "open" are different actions here. 

In the game, after unlocking, maybe they need to open it. The user tried "ensure that the wooden door is open" which wasn't a verb. So perhaps the correct command is "open the wooden door". Let me check the previous steps. The user had already unlocked the door, but maybe the door is still closed. So the next action should be to open it. But the game might require the exact phrase. The user tried "open the wooden door" but maybe it's not allowed. Alternatively, maybe "open the door" is sufficient. 

Wait, the user's last action was "go east", which the game rejected because the door wasn't open. So the correct next step is to open the door. The user needs to use the correct command. The game might expect "open the wooden door" or "open door". Since the door was unlocked, maybe the user needs to open it. So the next command should be "open the wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld. Their task is to follow a series of steps to complete a goal. So far, they've opened an antique trunk, retrieved an old key, unlocked a wooden door, and opened it. Now they need to head east, ensure the screen door is open, then go east again, try to move south, pick up a bell pepper, use it to go north, go west, and place the bell pepper on the stove.

The current step after opening the wooden door is to head east. The user just tried "go east" and it worked. Now, the next step in the original task is to "ensure that the screen door is open." But the user might not have a screen door yet. Wait, maybe after going east from the bedroom, they enter a new room. Let me check the previous steps.

The user was in the bedroom, opened the wooden door east, and now they're in the next room. The original task says after opening the wooden door, ensure the screen door is open. So perhaps in the new room, there's a screen door that needs to be opened. But the user hasn't interacted with it yet. However, the user's last action was "go east," which led them to a new room. Now, they need to check if there's a screen door there. If there is, they need to open it. But the user's next command should be to open the screen door. However, the user might not know the exact name of the door. Alternatively, maybe the screen door is part of the current room's description.

Wait, the user's last message was after opening the wooden door, and the next step is to "ensure that the screen door is open." So the user needs to open the screen door. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next action is to open the screen door. But the user might have to first check if the screen door exists. However, in the game, the user might have to use the correct command. The user's previous attempt was "go east," which worked. Now, they need to open the screen door. The correct command would be "open screen door" or "open the screen door." But the user has to make sure they use the right phrasing. Since the game's previous responses accept commands like "open the wooden door," maybe the correct command here is "open screen door." However, the user might have to check if the screen door is present. But according to the task, after going east, they need to ensure the screen door is open. So the next step is to open the screen door. Therefore, the correct command is "open screen door."

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen now. The original task was to go through several steps: open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock the door, ensure it's open, go east, open the screen door, go east again, try to move south, pick up the bell pepper, use it to go north, then go west and place the pepper on the stove.

So far, they've done the first few steps. They opened the trunk, took the key, unlocked the door, and now they're in the kitchen. The next step according to the original plan was to ensure the screen door is open. But when they tried "open screen door", the game said it wasn't there. Then they tried "go east", which led them to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, there's a closed screen door east and an open wooden door west. The user is probably supposed to open the screen door next. But the game didn't have a screen door in the bedroom, maybe it's in the kitchen now. The user's last action was "go east", which brought them to the kitchen. The current location is the kitchen, and the next step is to open the screen door east. But the user tried "open screen door" before and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "open the screen door" with "the" included. Or maybe the screen door is already open? Wait, the kitchen description says there's a closed screen door leading east. So the user needs to open it. The previous attempt was "open screen door", which the game didn't recognize. The correct command might be "open screen door" with "the" or without. Let me check the game's possible commands. In TextWorld, sometimes you need to specify "the" or not. The user tried "open screen door" and got an error. Maybe the correct command is "open the screen door". But the user's next action should be that. However, the user's last input was "go east", which led them to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the next step is to open the screen door east. So the correct command is "open the screen door". But the user might have missed the "the". Alternatively, maybe the screen door is already open, but the description says it's closed. So the user needs to open it. Therefore, the next action should be "open the screen door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in the TextWorld game. Their goal is to eventually pick up the bell pepper from the garden and place it on the stove. So far, they've navigated through the Bedroom, unlocked the door, gone east to the Kitchen, opened the screen door, and then moved to the Backyard.

The current location is the Backyard. The next step in the original task was to "try to move south" after ensuring the screen door is open. But in the Backyard, the user is told that moving south is unblocked. So the next logical step would be to try moving south from the Backyard. 

Looking at the environment description, the Backyard has a screen door leading west and a path south. The user's next action should be to move south. The user's previous action was "go east" which led them to the Backyard. Now, they need to attempt to move south. The game's feedback after moving south would then lead them to the next area, possibly the Garden where the bell pepper is located. 

Since the user's task includes picking up the bell pepper from the garden and then placing it on the stove, moving south from the Backyard is the next necessary step. The user needs to continue following the sequence of actions as outlined in the initial instructions. Therefore, the correct next command is to move south.

Then they opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, and then south to the garden. Now, in the garden, they picked up the bell pepper.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in the TextWorld game. Their goal was to open the antique trunk, get the old key, unlock the wooden door, ensure it's open, go east, open the screen door, go east again, try to move south, pick up the bell pepper, use it to go north, then go west and place the bell pepper on the stove.

So far, they've managed to get the bell pepper and tried to go north, but ended up back in the backyard. Now, they're in the garden again, with the bell pepper picked up. The next step according to the original plan was to place the bell pepper on the stove. But the current location is the garden, and the stove is in the kitchen. Wait, the user is in the garden, so they need to find a way back to the kitchen.

Looking at the previous movements: they went from the bedroom to the kitchen, then to the backyard, then to the garden. Now, they need to get back to the kitchen to place the bell pepper on the stove. The garden has a north exit back to the backyard, which has a west exit to the kitchen. So the path is garden -> backyard -> kitchen. But the user is in the garden, so they should go north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. However, the user's last action was going south from the backyard to the garden again. Now, they need to go north from the garden to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. Once in the kitchen, they can place the bell pepper on the stove.

But the current prompt says that in the garden, there's a milk, half a bag of chips, and a shovel on the floor. The user has the bell pepper. So the next step is to go north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, place the bell pepper on the stove. However, the user's last action was "go south" which brought them back to the garden. So the next step should be to go north to the backyard. Then, from the backyard, go west to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, use the bell pepper on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next action is to go north from the garden to the backyard.

-= Backyard =-
You've just shown up in a backyard.

You can see a set of chairs. However, the set of chairs, like an empty set of chairs, has nothing on it. You move on, clearly done caring about TextWorld. You can make out a bbq. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a patio table. The patio table is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Garden =-
You arrive in a garden. A typical kind of place.



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

There is a milk, a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Garden and Backyard. They've been going back and forth between the two areas. The original goal was to pick up the bell pepper, place it on the stove, and then proceed. But the user has already picked up the bell pepper and is trying to go north again.

Wait, in the Garden, after picking up the bell pepper, the next step was to "attempt to head north" with the bell pepper. But when they tried going north, they ended up back in the Backyard. The Garden's description says there's a milk, half a bag of chips, and a shovel on the floor. The user might need to place the bell pepper on the stove, but the stove is in the Kitchen, which they've already been to.

Wait, the user's last action was going north from the Garden, which took them back to the Backyard. The Garden's north exit is probably leading back to the Backyard. The user needs to place the bell pepper on the stove, but the stove is in the Kitchen. However, the user is currently in the Backyard. So maybe they need to go back to the Kitchen, but the screen door is open west, leading back to the Kitchen. Wait, in the Backyard, the screen door is leading west, which would take them back to the Kitchen. Then from the Kitchen, they can go to the Garden again. But the user needs to place the bell pepper on the stove. The stove is in the Kitchen. So the user needs to go back to the Kitchen, then to the Garden, then to the stove.

But the user is currently in the Backyard. So the next step should be to go west through the screen door to the Kitchen. Then, from the Kitchen, go to the Garden again, then find the stove. Wait, but the stove is in the Kitchen. So once in the Kitchen, the user can go to the stove and place the bell pepper there. But the user hasn't been to the Kitchen since the beginning. Let me check the previous steps.

Earlier, after unlocking the door and going east, the user entered the Kitchen. Then they opened the screen door, went east to the Backyard, then south to the Garden. Now, they are back in the Backyard. So the user needs to go west back to the Kitchen, then go to the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to go west from the Backyard to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, go to the stove and place the bell pepper. But the user is currently in the Backyard, so the next command should be "go west" to return to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, they can go to the stove and place the bell pepper. However, the user's last action was "go north" which brought them back to the Backyard. So the correct next step is to go west to the Kitchen.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. It seems to be pretty usual here.

Were you looking for a refrigerator? Because look over there, it's a refrigerator. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you make out a note. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in the TextWorld game. Their goal was to open the antique trunk, get the old key, unlock the wooden door, ensure it's open, go east, open the screen door, go east again, then move south, pick up the bell pepper, use it to go north, then go west and place the bell pepper on the stove.

So far, they've managed to get through the bedroom, kitchen, backyard, and garden. They picked up the bell pepper in the garden and tried going north, which led them back to the backyard. Now, they're in the kitchen again. The next step according to the original plan was to place the bell pepper on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, so that's the logical next move. The user is currently in the kitchen, so the command should be to place the bell pepper on the stove. Let me check if that's the correct action here. The stove is mentioned in the kitchen description, and the bell pepper is in the user's inventory. So the correct command is "place the bell pepper on the stove".
