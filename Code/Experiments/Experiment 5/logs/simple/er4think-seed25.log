Welcome to another profound episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be good if you could ensure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is open. Then, take the old key from the chest drawer. And then, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. After that, ensure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is open. Then, go east. That done, ensure that the screen door in the kitchen is open. After pulling open the screen door, travel east. Then, move south. And then, retrieve the milk from the floor of the garden. Then, try to go to the north. Following that, move west. With that done, sit the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal kind of place.

You scan the room for a chest drawer, and you find a chest drawer. You can see an antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is ordinary. However, the king-size bed, like an empty king-size bed, has nothing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started by opening the chest drawer, taking the old key, unlocking the wooden door, and opening it. Now they're at the bedroom's eastern door, which they've opened. The next step according to the original plan was to go east. So after opening the door, the logical next action would be to move east. The user hasn't done that yet. The current location is the bedroom, and the door leading east is open. So the next command should be "go east".

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You've just walked into a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can make out a refrigerator. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. The counter is standard. But the thing is empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You scan the room, seeing a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

You arrive in a backyard. An ordinary one.

You can make out a set of chairs. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You see a bbq. The bbq appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can make out a patio table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The patio table appears to be empty.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Backyard now. The original goal was to retrieve the milk from the garden and then follow certain steps. The current score is 7/8. The user has opened the screen door in the kitchen, gone east to the backyard. The backyard has a patio table and chairs, but nothing seems to be there. The next step according to the original plan was to move south after opening the screen door and going east. Wait, the user just came from the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east to the backyard. Now, the backyard has an unguarded exit to the south. The original instructions said after going east (from the kitchen), move south. So the next action should be to go south. The user needs to move south from the backyard. The command would be "go south".

-= Garden =-
You arrive in a garden. A normal kind of place.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a lettuce, a milk, a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor.

<think>
Okay, the user tried to take the milk from the floor, but it didn't work. Let me check the current situation. The garden has a lettuce, a milk, a half of a bag of chips, and a shovel on the floor. The user is at the garden, and the next step was to retrieve the milk. Maybe the milk is not visible or not in the right place. Wait, the user said "take milk from floor" but the game responded that it can't see any such thing. Maybe the milk is not on the floor? Or maybe the correct command is just "take milk" without specifying the floor. Let me think. The original goal was to "retrieve the milk from the floor of the garden." So perhaps the correct command is "take milk from floor" but the game doesn't recognize it. Alternatively, maybe the milk is in a different location. Wait, the user is in the garden, and the items are on the floor. Maybe the correct command is just "take milk" and the game will pick it up. But the user tried "take milk from floor" and it didn't work. Maybe the milk is not on the floor. Let me check the description again. The garden has "a lettuce, a milk, a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor." So the milk is on the floor. So the correct command should be "take milk from floor". But the game said "can't see any such thing". Maybe the game expects a different command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to pick it up without specifying the floor. Maybe "take milk" is sufficient. But the user tried "take milk from floor" and it didn't work. Maybe the game has a different way of handling it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look around again. But the user is supposed to follow the original steps. The original steps said "retrieve the milk from the floor of the garden." So the correct command is "take milk from floor". But the game didn't recognize it. Maybe the game is expecting "take milk" without the "from floor" part. Let me try that. The user's next action should be "take milk".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps correctly. They retrieved the milk from the garden and then went back to the kitchen. Now, they're in the kitchen again. The original goal was to "sit the milk on the stove." The user has the milk in their inventory now. The next step would be to go to the stove. But in the kitchen, the stove is mentioned as being empty. So the user needs to place the milk on the stove. The command would be "put milk on stove". Let me check if that's the correct action. The user has the milk, so putting it on the stove makes sense. The kitchen has a stove, so that's the right place. The previous steps were correct, so this should be the next move.
