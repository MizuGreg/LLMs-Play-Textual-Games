Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, ensure that the chest drawer is open. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. With the old key, doublecheck that the wooden door is unlocked. And then, open the wooden door within the bedroom. Then, attempt to go east. Then, make absolutely sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is opened. And then, attempt to venture east. Next, travel south. And then, lift the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. Then, make an effort to move north. If you can finish that, venture west. And then, rest the half of a bag of chips on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just sauntered into a bedroom. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can see a chest drawer. You can see an antique trunk. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

<think>
Okay, let me see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has followed a series of steps. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and then had to open it before going east. They did open the door, and now they're at the next part.

The task was to go east from the bedroom, then check the kitchen screen door, go east again, travel south, pick up the bag of chips, move north, go west, and put the chips on the stove. So far, they've done the first part: opened the door and moved east. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to make sure the screen door in the kitchen is open and then go east again. But the user's last action was opening the wooden door, which led them to the next room, probably the kitchen.

Wait, the user's current location is after opening the wooden door. The next step in the original plan was to "make absolutely sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is opened. And then, attempt to venture east." So they need to check the kitchen's screen door. But the user hasn't mentioned entering the kitchen yet. So the next action should be to check the screen door in the kitchen. But how? The user would need to look around to find it. So the next command should be to look at the screen door or open it if it's closed. But the original instruction says to "make sure it's opened," so maybe the user needs to open it if it's closed. However, the user's previous action was going east after opening the door, which might have led them into the kitchen. But the system message says the current location is the bedroom with the wooden door open. Wait, the user's last action was opening the wooden door, which was leading east. So after opening the door, they would go east into the next room, which is the kitchen. Then, they need to check the screen door there.

But the user's next step is to "make absolutely sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is opened." So the user needs to look for the screen door in the kitchen. So the next command should be to look at the screen door or open it. But the user's previous action was going east, which might have already moved them into the kitchen. However, the system message shows that the current location is the bedroom, so maybe the user hasn't moved yet. Wait, the user's last action was "open wooden door," which would allow them to go east. So the next step is to go east into the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, they need to check the screen door. So the next command should be "go east" again. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the original plan says after opening the wooden door, they should attempt to go east. But the system message says that when they tried to go east, they had to open the door first. So after opening the door, they can go east. So the next step is to go east into the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, they need to open the screen door. So the next command is "go east" to enter the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, check the screen door. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to go east into the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, open the screen door if it's closed. But the user's next action should be to go east again. However, the user is in the bedroom, after opening the door. So the next command is "go east" to enter the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, check the screen door. So the next action is "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a refrigerator. Hmmm... what else, what else? You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio table. The patio table is normal. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Garden scene. The items on the floor are an apple, lettuce, half of a bag of chips, and a shovel. The previous attempt was to "pick up half of a bag of chips from floor," but the system said "I only understood you as far as wanting to pick up the half of a bag of chips." So maybe the correct command is just "take half of a bag of chips" or "pick up half of a bag of chips."

Wait, the user tried "take half of a bag of chips from floor" and got a response that they couldn't see it. Then they tried "pick up half of a bag of chips from floor" and the system said they only understood up to picking it up. So maybe the correct command is just "take half of a bag of chips" without specifying the floor. Or maybe "pick up half of a bag of chips."

But in the game's previous steps, when they were in the Garden, the description says "There is an apple, a lettuce, a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor." So the half of a bag of chips is on the floor. The user needs to pick it up. The correct command would be "take half of a bag of chips" or "pick up half of a bag of chips." The system might be expecting "take" instead of "pick up." Let me check the previous interactions.

In the Garden, after the user tried "pick up half of a bag of chips from floor," the system responded with "I only understood you as far as wanting to pick up the half of a bag of chips." So maybe the correct command is just "take half of a bag of chips" without the "from floor" part. Because the system didn't recognize the "from floor" part, but the item is on the floor. So the user should try "take half of a bag of chips" again. Alternatively, maybe "pick up half of a bag of chips."

But the user's next action after that was to "rest the half of a bag of chips on the stove," which implies that they had already picked it up. So perhaps the correct command is "take half of a bag of chips" without the "from floor" part. Let me check the previous steps again.

So the user should try "take half of a bag of chips."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to rest the half of a bag of chips on the stove. But the game keeps saying that's not a recognized verb. Hmm. Maybe the correct command is different. Let me think about the possible actions here.

In the Backyard, the user has the half of a bag of chips. The goal was to rest it on the stove. But the stove is in the Kitchen, right? Wait, the user just went from the Garden to the Backyard. The stove is in the Kitchen, which is east of the Bedroom. But the user is currently in the Backyard. So maybe they need to go back to the Kitchen?

Wait, the user's last action was going north from the Garden to the Backyard. Now they're in the Backyard. The stove is in the Kitchen. So the user needs to get back to the Kitchen. Let me check the previous steps.

Earlier, the user went east from the Bedroom through the wooden door, then through the screen door in the Kitchen, then east to the Backyard. Now they're in the Backyard. To get to the Kitchen, they might need to go west through the screen door. But the Backyard has an open screen door leading west, which would take them back to the Kitchen. Then, once in the Kitchen, they can go east to the Bedroom? Wait, no. The Kitchen's screen door is east, and the wooden door is west. So from the Backyard, west is Kitchen. Then in the Kitchen, the stove is there. So the user needs to go west to the Kitchen, then find the stove and put the chips there.

But the user is currently in the Backyard. So the next step should be to go west to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, they can put the chips on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct action now is to go west to the Kitchen. Then, once there, use the command to put the chips on the stove. But the user is in the Backyard, so the next command should be "go west" to reach the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, they can "put half of a bag of chips on stove" or something similar. But the game might require a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe "rest" isn't the right verb, and "put" is. But the user tried "rest" and it didn't work. So maybe the correct verb is "put".

But the user is in the Backyard, so they need to go to the Kitchen first. So the next action should be "go west" to get to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, they can put the chips on the stove. So the current step is to go west.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the kitchen and bathroom, going back and forth. The original goal was to rest the half of a bag of chips on the stove. But in the current scenario, the user is in the bathroom, and the only exit is south back to the kitchen. The user has the half of a bag of chips, but they can't find the stove in the bathroom. The kitchen has a stove, but the user is stuck in a loop.

Wait, earlier in the garden, the user picked up the half of a bag of chips. Then they went back to the backyard, then kitchen, then bathroom, and back. The stove is in the kitchen. But the user is in the bathroom now. The only way to get back to the kitchen is to go south. Once in the kitchen, they need to rest the chips on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. The problem is that the user is stuck in the bathroom and can't get back to the kitchen to complete the task. The correct action would be to go south from the bathroom back to the kitchen, then rest the chips on the stove. But the user has been repeatedly going north and south between the two rooms. The next step should be to go south from the bathroom to the kitchen, then rest the chips on the stove. However, the user's last action was going north again, which is incorrect. The correct next action is to go south to the kitchen, then rest the chips on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the answer should be to go south from the bathroom to the kitchen, then rest the chips on the stove. But according to the instructions, the user should only output the next command. Since the user is in the bathroom, the next command is go south.

Look at that board! What does it say? It says Welcome to the bathroom? Well that's cool. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call "looking."

You can see a closed toilet. You can see a closed bath. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a sink. The sink is ordinary. On the sink you see a toothbrush.

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the kitchen and bathroom, going back and forth. The original goal was to rest the half of a bag of chips on the stove. But the user hasn't managed to do that yet. The last attempt to rest the chips on the stove wasn't successful because the command wasn't recognized.

Looking at the current position, the user is in the kitchen again. The stove is mentioned in the kitchen description. The user has the half of a bag of chips. So the next logical step is to try placing the chips on the stove. The previous attempt used "rest half of a bag of chips on stove," but the game didn't recognize it. Maybe the correct command is "put half of a bag of chips on stove" or "place half of a bag of chips on stove." The user might need to use the exact phrasing the game expects.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first go to the stove's location. But in the kitchen, the stove is present. So the user should try the command again with the correct verb. Since "rest" didn't work, trying "put" might be the right verb. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "rest" and it failed. So the correct command is likely "put half of a bag of chips on stove."
