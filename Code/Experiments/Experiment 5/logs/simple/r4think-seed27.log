Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to look and see that the antique trunk is open. After that, pick up the old key from the antique trunk in the bedroom. After that, insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it. And then, ensure that the wooden door in the bedroom is open. After that, travel east. Okay, and then, doublecheck that the refrigerator is ajar. Then, take the milk from the refrigerator. Then, place the milk on the stove inside the kitchen. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You can see an antique trunk. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a king-size bed. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, and tried to insert it into the wooden door. But the game didn't recognize "insert" as a valid command. The user then tried "use old key on wooden door," which also didn't work.

Hmm, in text-based games, the commands are usually more straightforward. Instead of saying "insert," maybe the correct action is to "unlock" the door with the key. Or perhaps "use" the key on the door. Wait, the user tried "use old key on wooden door" and got an error. Maybe the game expects a different phrasing, like "use key on door" or "unlock door with key."

Looking back at the previous steps, the user had to pick up the key from the trunk, then insert it into the lock. The correct command might be "use old key on wooden door" but the game didn't recognize it. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is for the lock. So the action should be "unlock wooden door with old key" or something similar.

Wait, the user's last attempt was "use old key on wooden door," which the game didn't recognize. The error message says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct verb is "unlock" instead of "use." Or perhaps the game expects "open" the door with the key. But the door is locked, so "unlock" makes more sense.

Alternatively, maybe the key is for the lock, so the action is "unlock the door" using the key. The correct command might be "unlock wooden door" if the key is already in hand. But the user has the key, so maybe just "unlock wooden door."

Wait, the user has the key, so the next step is to use it on the lock. The game might expect "use key on lock" or "unlock door with key." But the door is described as "wooden door inside the bedroom's lock," so maybe the correct action is "unlock wooden door."

But the user tried "use old key on wooden door" and it didn't work. Maybe the game expects "unlock wooden door" without specifying the key. Or maybe the key is already in the inventory, so the command is just "unlock wooden door."

Alternatively, the game might require the player to "open" the door with the key. But the door is locked, so "open" might not be the right verb. The correct action is likely "unlock wooden door."

So the next step would be to try "unlock wooden door." That's the most logical command here. The user needs to unlock the door with the key they have. Let's go with that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in a text-based game. Their goal is to open the antique trunk, get the key, use it to unlock the door, go east, check the fridge, get milk, and put it on the stove.

So far, they've opened the trunk, taken the key, tried to insert it into the door, and unlocked it. But when they tried to go east, the game said they needed to open the door first. They tried unlocking it again, but it was already unlocked. Then they tried going east again, and the game said they needed to open the door first again. That's confusing because they already unlocked it.

Wait, maybe the game considers "unlocked" different from "open"? Like, maybe the door is locked but not physically open. So even though they used the key to unlock it, they still need to push it open. The game might be expecting the action "open wooden door" instead of "unlock" even though it's already unlocked. Or maybe the door is stuck and needs some other action.

The user is stuck because they can't go east until the door is open. They tried unlocking again, but the game says it's already unlocked. So the next step should be to try opening the door physically. The correct action here is probably "open wooden door" even though it's already unlocked. The game might be expecting that command to proceed. So the user should try that next.

You've entered a kitchen.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a refrigerator. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a stove. The stove is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, the user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to complete objectives. Let me recap the current situation.

The user has already completed several tasks: opened the antique trunk, picked up the old key, unlocked the bedroom door, went east into the kitchen, opened the refrigerator, took the milk, and now they need to place the milk on the stove. The last attempt to "place milk on stove in kitchen" was rejected because the system didn't recognize it as a valid verb.

So, the next step is to figure out the correct command to place the milk on the stove. In text adventures, actions are usually verbs that match the game's vocabulary. The user tried "place," but maybe the correct verb is "put." Let me check the previous commands. The user said "take milk from refrigerator," which worked. So "put" might be the right verb here.

Alternatively, maybe the command is "put milk on stove." But the user's previous command was "place milk on stove in kitchen," which was rejected. The game might expect a simpler command like "put milk on stove" without specifying the location again. Or perhaps "put milk on the stove."

Another possibility is that the game uses "put" as the verb. Since "place" wasn't accepted, switching to "put" might work. The user needs to try that. Let me confirm: the correct command is likely "put milk on stove" or "put milk on the stove." The user should try that next.
