Welcome to TextWorld! First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After pulling open the antique trunk, recover the old key from the antique trunk within the bedroom. Then, insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. And then, ensure that the wooden door is open. And then, make an effort to head east. After that, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. After that, go to the east. And then, make an attempt to take a trip south. Following that, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. If you have picked up the milk, venture north. And then, go west. And then, sit the milk on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. The room is well lit.

You can make out a chest drawer. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an antique trunk. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. The goal seems to be to follow a series of steps to reach the original goal, which isn't explicitly stated, but based on the instructions given, it's probably about getting the milk to the stove or something similar.

So far, the player has opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and moved east. The next step in the original instructions was to "make an effort to head east" after unlocking the door. Then check the screen door, go east again, try to go south, pick up the milk, go north, west, and put the milk on the stove.

Wait, the user's last action was unlocking the wooden door, which took the score to 3/4. The next step according to the initial instructions was to "make an effort to head east" after unlocking the door. So the player should now go east. But the user might have already done that? Let me check the history.

Looking back: After unlocking the door, the next step in the user's actions was to "make an effort to head east." So the next command should be "go east." The user's last action was unlocking the door, so the next step is to go east. Then check the screen door, go east again, try to go south, etc.

But the user's current location is the bedroom, after unlocking the door. The wooden door was leading east, so after unlocking it, the player is probably now in the room beyond the door. Wait, the initial description said "There is a closed wooden door leading east." So when you unlock it, you would go through it. So after unlocking, the next step is to go east (through the door). Then, the next steps involve checking the screen door, going east again, trying to go south, etc.

So the next action should be "go east" to move through the unlocked door. Then, after that, check the screen door. So the current step is after unlocking the door, so the next command is "go east."

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld. The goal seems to be to follow a series of steps to reach the original goal, which isn't explicitly stated, but from the initial instructions, it probably involves opening doors, finding items, and moving through rooms.

The user has already opened the antique trunk in the bedroom, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and tried to go east. However, the game is reminding them that they need to open the wooden door first before proceeding. But the user keeps trying to go east without opening the door, which is causing the game to prompt them again.

Wait, the user tried to go east but the game says they have to open the wooden door first. But earlier, they already unlocked the door. Maybe the door is locked, and unlocking doesn't mean it's open. The game might be using "unlock" and "open" as different actions. So even though they unlocked the door, they need to open it first. But the user tried to go east without opening it, which is why the game is preventing that.

So the correct action here would be to open the wooden door after unlocking it. The user has the key, so they need to open the door. But the game might have a step where after unlocking, you have to open it. Let me check the previous steps again.

In the history, the user inserted the key into the lock and unlocked the door. Then they tried to go east, but the game said they need to open the door first. So maybe "unlock" is different from "open". So the next step should be to open the wooden door. But the user tried to go east again, which is why the game is prompting again.

So the correct next action is to open the wooden door. But the user might have already unlocked it, so they need to open it. Therefore, the next command should be "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. They've gone through the bedroom, opened the trunk, got the key, unlocked the door, and went east into the kitchen. Then they went south into the living room. The current location is the living room.

The original goal mentioned in the initial instructions was to eventually reach the garden, pick up the milk, and then do some steps involving the stove. But so far, the user hasn't mentioned the garden yet. Let me check the steps again.

The user's path so far: Bedroom → Kitchen → Living Room. The next step after the living room is to go north, as the living room's description says "try going north, that entranceway is unblocked." But the user's last action was going south from the kitchen to the living room. Now, in the living room, the available directions are north, east, west, south? Wait, the living room description says there's a tv, a couch, a table, etc., and mentions "try going north, that entranceway is unblocked." So maybe the user needs to go north from the living room.

But the original plan was after getting the milk in the garden, then going north, then west, then putting the milk on the stove. But the user hasn't reached the garden yet. So maybe the next step is to go north from the living room. However, the user's current location is the living room, and the next action would be to go north. But the user is asking if they're on the right track and what the next action should be.

Wait, the user's last action was "go south" from the kitchen to the living room. Now, in the living room, the description says "You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked." So the next logical step would be to go north. But the user is asking if they're close to the goal. The original goal involved going east, then south, then north, then west, etc. But maybe the user is supposed to proceed through the rooms, and the next step is to go north from the living room. However, the user might have gotten confused with the directions. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the kitchen again for the milk, but the milk was mentioned in the garden step. Wait, the initial instructions said: "lift the milk from the floor of the garden. If you have picked up the milk, venture north. And then, go west. And then, sit the milk on the stove."

So the milk is in the garden. The user hasn't reached the garden yet. So the current path is bedroom → kitchen → living room. The next step would be to go north from the living room, which might lead to another area. But the user is in the living room, and the directions available are north, as per the description. So the next action should be to go north. But the user is asking if they're on the right track. The user might be confused because they haven't reached the garden yet. However, according to the steps, after unlocking the door and going east (into the kitchen), then going south (to the living room), then north would be the next step. But the original plan was after getting the milk in the garden, then going north, west, etc. So maybe the user is on the right track, but needs to continue moving through the rooms. The next action would be to go north from the living room. However, the user's current location is the living room, and the next step is to go north. So the answer should be "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. Their goal seems to be to follow a series of steps to reach the original goal, which isn't explicitly stated, but based on the instructions given, it's probably about navigating through the rooms and completing certain tasks.

So far, they've started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and then went east into the kitchen. Then they went south to the living room and back north to the kitchen again. The user is now in the kitchen again, and the assistant needs to decide the next action.

Looking at the current room (Kitchen), the possible exits are east (closed screen door), west (open wooden door), and north (exit). The user has been moving between these rooms, but the original instructions mentioned going east after opening the door, then checking the screen door, then going east again, then trying to go south, etc. However, the user has been looping between kitchen and living room.

The original goal might involve collecting items like the milk in the garden, but the user hasn't reached the garden yet. The steps mentioned include lifting the milk from the garden, then going north, then west, then putting the milk on the stove. But the user is currently in the kitchen. To get to the garden, they might need to go through the screen door east, but it's closed. Alternatively, maybe there's another path.

Wait, in the kitchen, there's a note on the kitchen island. Maybe that's a clue, but the user hasn't interacted with it yet. However, the instructions didn't mention the note, so maybe it's not relevant. The user needs to follow the exact steps given.

The original plan was: after unlocking the door and going east (into kitchen), check the screen door, then go east again, then try to go south. But in the current state, the user is in the kitchen, and the screen door is closed. So maybe the next step is to open the screen door east. But the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, maybe they need to go west back to the bedroom, but that seems like it's going backward.

Wait, the original instructions said after unlocking the door and going east, check the screen door, then go east again. But in the current state, the user is in the kitchen, and the screen door is closed. So perhaps the next step is to open the screen door east. But the user hasn't tried that yet. However, the user's last action was going north again, which brings them back to the kitchen. So maybe the next step is to check the screen door east, open it, then proceed.

But the user's current score is 5/15, and they need to continue following the steps. The original plan mentioned after going east (into kitchen), check the screen door, then go east again. But the screen door is closed, so they need to open it. However, the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to open the screen door east. But the user's last action was going north, which is already done. So maybe the next step is to go east to the screen door, open it, then proceed.

But the user is in the kitchen, and the screen door is east. So the next command should be "go east" to reach the screen door, then "open screen door". But the user's previous action was "go north", which is redundant. So maybe the user is stuck in a loop. However, the assistant needs to follow the original steps. The original steps said after going east (into kitchen), check the screen door (which is closed), then go east again. But the user is in the kitchen, so maybe the next step is to go east to the screen door, open it, then proceed.

But the user's last action was "go north", which brings them back to the kitchen. So the next step should be "go east" to the screen door. However, the user might need to open it first. But the instructions didn't specify that. The original steps said "doublecheck that the screen door is wide open" before going east again. So maybe the user needs to open the screen door first. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east again from the kitchen, but the screen door is closed. So the next action is "go east" to the screen door, then "open screen door". But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next command should be "go east".

They've also opened the screen door. The current location is the kitchen, and the next step mentioned in the initial instructions was to "doublecheck that the screen door is wide open," which they did by opening it. Now, after opening the screen door, the next step in the original plan was to "go to the east." But in the previous interaction, when they tried to go east, the game indicated that the screen door needed to be opened first, which they did. Now, after opening the screen door, the next logical step would be to go east.

The user's current action is to open the screen door, which they did, and the score increased. The next command should be to go east. The user has been following the steps closely, so continuing with "go east" makes sense here. The game's response after opening the screen door would likely allow them to proceed east, leading them closer to the next steps in the original goal. Therefore, the correct next action is to go east.

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. A normal kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a set of chairs. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a set of chairs in a room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a bbq. The bbq is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You make out a patio table. The patio table is ordinary. The patio table appears to be empty.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the south.



Your score has just gone up by one point.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've been following a set of instructions to progress through different rooms. The goal seems to involve collecting items and navigating through various rooms, ultimately reaching a point where they can sit the milk on the stove.

So far, the user has opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and gone east to the kitchen. Then they moved around between the kitchen, living room, and backyard. Now, they're in the backyard, and the next step according to the original instructions was to "lift the milk from the floor of the garden." But the current location is the backyard, not the garden. However, the user might have misunderstood the locations or the steps.

Looking at the current room, the backyard has a patio table and a BBQ, but no mention of milk. The previous step was going east from the kitchen, which led to the backyard. The user might need to check the kitchen again for the milk, or maybe the garden is a different area. But according to the instructions, after going east from the kitchen, the next step was to "lift the milk from the floor of the garden." However, the user is now in the backyard, not the garden. Maybe there's a confusion between the backyard and the garden here.

Alternatively, maybe the garden is part of the backyard. The user needs to find the milk. Since the milk was mentioned in the garden, but the current location is the backyard, perhaps the user needs to check the backyard for the milk. But in the backyard description, there's no mention of milk. The user might have missed it or there's a step they haven't taken yet.

Wait, the original instructions said: "After that, go to the east. And then, make an attempt to take a trip south. Following that, lift the milk from the floor of the garden." So after going east from the kitchen (which led to the backyard), then try to go south. The backyard has an exit to the south. So going south from the backyard would take them back to the kitchen. But the milk is supposed to be in the garden. Maybe the garden is a different room, perhaps the kitchen or another area. Alternatively, maybe the garden is the backyard, and the user needs to look for the milk there.

But in the backyard, there's no mention of milk. The user might have to check the kitchen again. Wait, the kitchen had a note, but no milk. The living room had a remote and lettuce, but no milk. The garden might be a different area. Maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen, then east again to the backyard, then check the patio table or somewhere else for the milk. Alternatively, maybe the milk is in the garden, which is a separate room not yet explored.

But according to the current location, the user is in the backyard. The next step would be to go south back to the kitchen, then perhaps check other areas. However, the original instruction said to lift the milk from the garden. Since the user is in the backyard, maybe the garden is adjacent. Alternatively, maybe the garden is the kitchen's backyard. This is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the steps. The original plan was: after unlocking the door and going east, check the screen door, then go east to the backyard, then go south to the kitchen. But the milk is supposed to be in the garden. Maybe the garden is the backyard, and the user needs to look there. Since the backyard's description doesn't mention milk, perhaps the user needs to check the kitchen again or another area.

Alternatively, maybe the milk was left in the kitchen. The user might have missed it. But in the kitchen, the counter is empty, the stove is empty, and there's a note. So maybe the milk is in the garden, which is a different room. The user needs to find the garden. But according to the current map, the backyard is connected to the kitchen and the south exit. Maybe the garden is the backyard, and the user needs to look around. Since the user is in the backyard, perhaps they need to check the patio table or the BBQ for the milk. But the description says the patio table is empty. The BBQ is empty. So maybe the milk is not here.

This is a bit of a puzzle. The user needs to find the milk in the garden. Since they're in the backyard, maybe they need to go south to the kitchen, then check again. Alternatively, maybe the garden is the living room. But the living room has a couch with lettuce and a remote. No milk there. The original instructions might have a typo or the user might have misinterpreted the steps.

Alternatively, maybe the milk is in the backyard, but the description didn't mention it. The user might need to look more carefully. Since the user is in the backyard, the next step would be to check the patio table or the chairs for the milk. But according to the description, the patio table is empty. The chairs are empty. The BBQ is empty. So maybe the milk is not here. Then, perhaps the user needs to go back to the kitchen and check again, or find another way to get to the garden.

But according to the original plan, after going east from the kitchen (to the backyard), then go south to the kitchen, then lift the milk from the garden. But if the garden isn't accessible yet, maybe the user needs to find another path. Alternatively, maybe the garden is the backyard, and the user needs to look again. Since the user is in the backyard, the next action would be to check the patio table or the chairs, but the description says they're empty. So perhaps the user needs to proceed to the next step as per the original instructions, even if the milk isn't found yet. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go east again from the backyard, but the screen door is already open. Wait, in the kitchen, the screen door was opened, leading to the backyard. Now, in the backyard, the screen door is west, leading back to the kitchen. The user is in the backyard, and the next step is to go south to the kitchen. Then, maybe the milk is in the kitchen. But the kitchen's counter is empty. The stove is empty. The note is there. So maybe the milk is not in the kitchen.

This is confusing. The user needs to find the milk in the garden. Since the user is in the backyard, maybe the garden is the backyard, and the milk is on the floor. The user needs to pick it up. But the description says the patio table is empty. Maybe the milk is on the floor of the backyard. The user needs to pick it up. So the next action would be to pick up the milk. But the user hasn't done that yet. The original instructions said to "lift the milk from the floor of the garden." So the user is in the backyard, which is the garden. So the next step is to pick up the milk.

But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct action would be to pick up the milk. However, the user is in the backyard, and the milk is on the floor. The user needs to take it. So the next command should be "take milk" or "lift milk." But the user's previous actions were moving around. So the next step is to check the floor for the milk and pick it up.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the instructions from the original goal. The goal mentioned lifting the milk from the floor of the garden. But in the current location, which is the Backyard, there's no mention of milk. The user tried "lift milk from floor" but got an error.

So, maybe the milk is in a different location. Let me check the previous steps. The user went east from the kitchen, opened the screen door, and entered the backyard. In the backyard, the objects mentioned are chairs, a BBQ, a patio table. No milk there. The original instruction said "lift the milk from the floor of the garden." Wait, maybe the garden is a different room? But the current room is the backyard. Maybe there's a mistake in the environment setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the milk was picked up earlier but not yet carried. Wait, the user had to pick up the milk after going south, then go north, then west, then put it on the stove. But in the current scenario, the user is in the backyard. Maybe the milk is still in the backyard but not visible. Or maybe the user needs to check the patio table or chairs for the milk. But according to the description, the patio table is empty. The chairs are empty too. The BBQ is empty. So maybe the milk is not here. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen or another room where the milk might be. But the original steps said after lifting the milk from the garden, venture north. But if the milk isn't here, perhaps the user needs to check other locations. However, the current room is the backyard, and the next step should be to sit the milk on the stove. But the stove is in the kitchen. So maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen, but the exit is to the north. Wait, in the backyard, the exit is to the south. So maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen via the north exit. But the user is in the backyard, so the possible directions are west (screen door) and south (exit). The user might need to go back to the kitchen, then to the stove. But the milk is still in their inventory? Or maybe the user needs to find the milk again. But according to the previous steps, the user was supposed to lift the milk from the garden. Maybe the garden is the backyard. So perhaps the user needs to look again in the backyard for the milk. But the description doesn't mention it. Maybe the user made a mistake in the steps. Alternatively, the game might have an error. But since the user is stuck, the next action should be to check the patio table or chairs again. But the correct command would be to go back to the kitchen and then to the stove. But the user is in the backyard. So the next step is to go north to the kitchen, then go to the stove. But the user's last action was in the backyard. So the correct next step is to go north to the kitchen. But the user's previous attempt was to lift milk, which isn't possible. So the user needs to find the milk first. Maybe the milk is in the kitchen. Wait, the user was in the kitchen earlier. Maybe the milk was picked up in the kitchen. But the original instruction said to lift the milk from the garden. Maybe the garden is the backyard. So the user needs to find the milk in the backyard. But according to the description, there's no milk there. So perhaps the user needs to check the patio table again. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen and then to the stove. But the user is in the backyard.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. Their goal seems to be to complete a set of tasks, like opening the trunk, getting the key, unlocking the door, and then moving around the house to pick up the milk and other items.

First, they started in the bedroom, opened the trunk, took the key, unlocked the door, and went east to the kitchen. Then they moved around between the kitchen, living room, and backyard, trying to open doors and move around. They tried to lift the milk from the floor of the garden (backyard), but the game didn't recognize that command. The user then tried to go north, but that wasn't possible, so they went west back to the kitchen.

Now, the user is in the living room again. The next step in the original instructions was to "lift the milk from the floor of the garden" if they had picked up the milk. But in the current scenario, they're in the living room, and the milk wasn't mentioned there. The user might have missed picking up the milk earlier or maybe it's in a different location.

Looking at the previous steps, after going east to the kitchen, they opened the screen door and went to the backyard. In the backyard, there's a patio table and chairs, but no mention of milk. The user tried to lift the milk there but the command wasn't recognized. Maybe the milk is in another location, like the kitchen or living room?

Wait, the original instructions said: "Following that, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. If you have picked up the milk, venture north. And then, go west. And then, sit the milk on the stove." So the milk is in the garden (backyard), but the user tried to lift it there and the game didn't recognize the command. Maybe the correct command is "take milk" or "pick up milk" instead of "lift milk from floor"?

Alternatively, maybe the milk is in the kitchen or another room. But according to the game's current state, the user is in the living room. The next step after lifting the milk (if successful) would be to go north, but the user is currently in the living room. However, the user tried to go north from the backyard and couldn't, then went west back to the kitchen.

So, the user might need to go back to the backyard again, try picking up the milk again, but the command was incorrect. The correct command might be "take milk" or "get milk" instead of "lift milk from floor". The user might need to try that. Alternatively, maybe the milk is in the kitchen, but the game's description of the kitchen doesn't mention it. The user might need to check the kitchen again.

But the user is currently in the living room. The next action should be to go back to the backyard, try picking up the milk again with the correct command. However, the user's last action was going west to the kitchen, so they need to go east back to the backyard. Then, use the correct command to pick up the milk. Once that's done, they can go north to the next area and then west to the kitchen, then sit the milk on the stove.

But the user's current position is the living room. So the next step is to go north, but the living room's description says "You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked." So going north from the living room is possible. However, the original goal was to go north after picking up the milk. But the user hasn't picked up the milk yet. So maybe they need to go back to the backyard, pick up the milk, then go north.

But the user is in the living room now. The correct next step would be to go back to the backyard (east), then pick up the milk. However, the user's last action was going west to the kitchen, so they need to go east back to the backyard. Then, use the correct command to pick up the milk. The user might have made a mistake in the command earlier, so they need to try again with "take milk" or "get milk".

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game, and they've been following a set of instructions to navigate through different rooms and collect items. The goal seems to be to reach a certain point, maybe escape or complete a task.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Living Room again, and the score is at 7/25. The previous steps involved moving between rooms, opening doors, and trying to find the milk. The user tried to "lift milk from floor" but it wasn't recognized. Then they kept going back and forth between the Kitchen and Living Room.

The original instructions mentioned lifting the milk from the garden's floor and then going north after picking it up. But in the current scenario, the user is in the Living Room, and there's no mention of milk here. The Backyard had a patio table, but the milk wasn't there. Maybe the milk is in another location that hasn't been checked yet.

Wait, the user tried to go east from the Kitchen, which led to the Backyard. In the Backyard, there's a patio table, but the milk wasn't there. The Living Room has a couch with a lettuce and a remote, but no milk. The Kitchen has a refrigerator, but the counter is empty. The only place where milk was mentioned was the garden's floor, but the user hasn't checked there yet.

Wait, the original steps said: "lift the milk from the floor of the garden. If you have picked up the milk, venture north. And then, go west. And then, sit the milk on the stove." So maybe the milk is in the garden, but the user hasn't gone there yet. However, in the current state, the user is in the Living Room, and the only way to get to the garden would be through the Backyard or another exit.

But the user hasn't gone south from the Backyard yet. Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the Backyard, tried to go north (back to Kitchen), then went west to Kitchen again. Maybe the garden is accessible from the Backyard via the south exit. But in the Backyard description, the south exit is unguarded. So perhaps the user needs to go south from the Backyard to reach the garden.

But the user hasn't been to the garden yet. The milk is supposed to be on the floor of the garden. So the next step would be to go south from the Backyard to reach the garden, pick up the milk, then go north to the Kitchen, then west to the Living Room, then sit the milk on the stove. But the user is currently in the Living Room, so maybe they need to go back to the Kitchen, then to the Backyard, then south to the garden.

But the user's last action was going north from the Living Room to the Kitchen. So the next step would be to go south from the Kitchen to the Living Room again, then west to the Kitchen, then south to the Backyard, then south again to the garden. But the user hasn't tried that yet.

Alternatively, maybe the milk is in the Kitchen. Wait, the Kitchen's counter is empty, but the kitchen island has a note. Maybe the milk is in the fridge? But the user hasn't checked the refrigerator. However, the original instructions said to lift the milk from the garden's floor, not the fridge.

So the correct path is: after getting the key and opening the door, go east to the Kitchen, open the screen door, go east to the Backyard, then south to the garden to pick up the milk. Then go north to the Kitchen, west to the Living Room, then sit the milk on the stove.

But the user is currently in the Living Room, so they need to go back to the Kitchen, then to the Backyard, then south to the garden. However, the user hasn't gone south from the Backyard yet. The Backyard's south exit is unguarded, so they can go there. Then, in the garden, they can pick up the milk.

So the next action should be to go south from the Backyard to the garden. But the user is in the Living Room, so they need to go north to the Kitchen, then west to the Kitchen again, then south to the Backyard, then south again to the garden.

But the user is in the Living Room, so the next step is to go north to the Kitchen, then west to the Kitchen, then south to the Backyard, then south to the garden. However, the user hasn't done that yet. The current position is the Living Room, so the next command should be to go north to the Kitchen.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game, and they've been moving between rooms. The original goal mentioned in the initial instructions was to lift the milk from the garden and then proceed to the stove. But so far, the user has been moving between the bedroom, kitchen, living room, and backyard, but hasn't found the milk yet.

Looking at the current location, the user is in the Living Room. The instructions mentioned that after unlocking the door and going east, they needed to check the screen door, then go east again, and then try to take a trip south. Then, after lifting the milk from the garden, they had to go north and then west, and sit the milk on the stove.

But in the current state, the user is in the Living Room, and the only thing mentioned there is a lettuce on the couch, a remote, and a TV. There's no mention of milk here. The previous attempts to go south and north have just been looping between the Kitchen and Living Room. The user tried to "lift milk from floor" but it wasn't possible because the milk wasn't visible.

The next step would be to check the Backyard again, where the garden is supposed to be. The user had previously gone east through the screen door to the Backyard, but maybe they didn't look carefully enough. In the Backyard description, there's a patio table and a bbq, but no milk mentioned. However, the original goal said to "lift the milk from the floor of the garden." Maybe the milk is in the garden area, but the user hasn't checked there yet.

Wait, the user was in the Backyard and tried to lift the milk but couldn't because it wasn't there. Maybe the milk is in a different location. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the Kitchen or another room where the milk might be. But according to the initial instructions, the milk is in the garden, so perhaps the user needs to find it there.

But the user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Living Room. The next logical step would be to go back to the Backyard again, check the garden area, and look for the milk. However, the user hasn't been able to find it yet. Maybe the milk is on the floor of the garden, which is the Backyard. So the correct action would be to go back to the Backyard, then look for the milk there.

But in the current state, the user is in the Living Room. The only way to get to the Backyard is through the screen door in the Kitchen. So the user needs to go back to the Kitchen, open the screen door again, go east to the Backyard, and then check the garden floor for the milk. Then, once the milk is lifted, proceed to the stove.

But the user hasn't done that yet. The previous attempt to go east from the Kitchen led to the Backyard, but the milk wasn't there. Maybe the user needs to check the garden again. Alternatively, maybe the milk is in a different location. However, based on the initial instructions, the milk is in the garden, so the user needs to find it there.

So the next action should be to go back to the Kitchen, then east to the Backyard, and then look for the milk on the floor. Once found, lift it, then go north to the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. The current position is in the Living Room, so the user needs to go back to the Kitchen, then to the Backyard again.

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld, and they've been following a set of instructions to complete certain tasks. The goal seems to involve navigating through different rooms, opening doors, finding items like a key and milk, and eventually reaching a goal.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Living Room, and the score is at 7. The previous steps involved opening the antique trunk, getting the key, unlocking the door, and moving east to the kitchen. Then they went back and forth between the kitchen and living room, trying to find the milk. The user tried "lift milk from floor" but it wasn't recognized, so they might have been trying to find the milk in the backyard or another location.

Now, the user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Living Room, moving back and forth. The score hasn't increased much, and the milk hasn't been found. The original goal mentioned lifting the milk from the garden and then going north, but the user hasn't found the milk yet. The current location is the Living Room, and the next step might be to check the kitchen again for the milk, or maybe the backyard.

Wait, the user was supposed to go to the backyard through the screen door, but they might have missed that. The instructions said after unlocking the door and going east, they needed to check the screen door, open it, and then go east to the backyard. Then, in the backyard, lift the milk from the floor. But the user hasn't done that yet. Maybe they were trying to go north from the kitchen but got stuck.

Alternatively, maybe the milk is in the kitchen or living room. The user tried "take milk from floor" but it wasn't recognized. The correct command might be "lift milk" or "pick up milk" if it's on the floor. But in the current rooms, the user hasn't found the milk yet. The original plan was to go to the garden (backyard) to lift the milk. So the user needs to go east from the kitchen through the screen door to the backyard, then lift the milk there.

But the user is currently in the Living Room, so they need to go north to the kitchen again, then east to the backyard. Then, in the backyard, lift the milk. Once that's done, go north to the kitchen, then west back to the living room, and proceed with the next steps. However, the user hasn't done that yet, so they need to continue moving east from the kitchen to the backyard.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Living Room, going back and forth. The original goal was to lift the milk from the garden, but they haven't found it yet. The score is stuck at 7, and they've been moving between rooms without progress.

First, I need to check if the milk is in the Backyard. The user tried going east from the Kitchen, which led to the Backyard, but they couldn't find the milk there. The Backyard has a patio table and chairs, but no mention of milk. Maybe the milk is in the Kitchen or Living Room?

Wait, the user mentioned lifting the milk from the floor of the garden. But in the Backyard, there's no milk mentioned. Maybe the milk is in the Kitchen? The Kitchen has a refrigerator, but the user hasn't checked there. Or maybe the milk is in the Living Room? The Living Room has a couch with a lettuce and a remote, but no milk.

Alternatively, maybe the user didn't find the milk because they didn't check the right place. The original instruction said to lift the milk from the garden, which is the Backyard. But the Backyard description doesn't mention milk. Maybe the milk is in the Kitchen, and the user needs to check there.

But the user's last action was going north from the Living Room back to the Kitchen. They need to check the Kitchen again. The Kitchen has a refrigerator, maybe the milk is inside. But the user hasn't opened the refrigerator yet. The score is low, so maybe they need to open the fridge to find the milk.

Alternatively, maybe the milk is in the Living Room, but the user hasn't looked there. The Living Room has a low table with a remote, but no milk. Hmm.

Wait, the user's original plan was: after unlocking the door, go east, check the screen door, then go east again, then try to go south. But they got stuck in a loop. Maybe they need to check the Backyard again for the milk. But the Backyard doesn't have milk. Maybe the milk is in the Kitchen, and the user needs to open the refrigerator.

So the next step should be to check the refrigerator in the Kitchen. The user hasn't done that yet. So the command should be "open refrigerator" or "look in refrigerator". But the game might require the exact command. Since the user is in the Kitchen, they need to open the refrigerator to find the milk.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to reach the goal. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the key, unlocked the door, and navigated through the kitchen, living room, and bathroom. They've also collected items like the tomato plant and apple from the refrigerator.

The current location is the Living Room, and the next step according to the original instructions was to lift the milk from the floor of the garden. But the user hasn't encountered the garden yet. They've been moving between rooms without seeing the garden. The problem might be that the garden isn't part of the current path, so the user hasn't picked up the milk yet.

Looking at the recent movements, the user went from the Kitchen to the Living Room and back. The next logical step would be to check the garden, which is mentioned in the original instructions. However, the user hasn't been directed there yet. The screen door in the Kitchen leads east, which previously led to the Backyard. Maybe the garden is part of the Backyard or a different area.

But in the current state, the user is in the Living Room. The original plan was to go east, check the screen door, then go to the east, then try to go south, then lift the milk. However, the user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Living Room. The milk hasn't been picked up because the garden isn't accessible yet.

The correct next action should be to go east from the Kitchen through the screen door to the Backyard, then look for the milk on the floor. But the user hasn't done that yet. The previous attempt to go east from the Living Room was blocked, but from the Kitchen, the screen door is open. So the user needs to go east from the Kitchen to the Backyard, then check the floor for the milk.

Okay, let's try to figure out what the user needs here. They're in a TextWorld game, and they've been moving around different rooms. The original goal was to follow a series of steps: open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock the door, go east, check the screen door, then proceed to the garden, pick up the milk, etc.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Kitchen again, with a score of 7. They've been going back and forth between the Kitchen, Living Room, and Bathroom. The last action was going north from the Living Room to the Kitchen. Now, the user is asked to decide their next move.

The key points from the original instructions were: after getting the milk, go north, then west, then put the milk on the stove. But the user hasn't picked up the milk yet. The milk was supposed to be on the floor of the garden, which they hadn't reached yet. 

Wait, the user tried going east from the Kitchen but couldn't because the screen door was closed. They opened it, went east to the Backyard, but couldn't find the milk. Then they kept looping between rooms. The problem might be that they didn't find the milk in the garden. 

But in the current state, they're in the Kitchen again. The score is 7, and they need to reach the original goal. Maybe they need to go back to the garden, find the milk, pick it up, then proceed to the stove. However, the user hasn't tried going south from the Kitchen to the Backyard again. 

Alternatively, maybe the milk is in the Kitchen? But the original instruction said it's in the garden. The user might have missed it earlier. Or perhaps the milk is in the Living Room? But the Living Room had a lettuce on the couch and a remote. 

Wait, the user tried going east from the Kitchen, opened the screen door, went to the Backyard, but couldn't find the milk. Then they kept moving between rooms. Maybe they need to go back to the Backyard again, check the floor, and pick up the milk. 

So the next step should be to go south from the Kitchen to the Backyard again. But in the previous attempts, when they tried going south from the Kitchen, they ended up in the Living Room. Wait, no, the Kitchen's south exit is to the Living Room, but the Backyard is east of the Kitchen. So maybe the user is confused about the directions. 

Wait, the Kitchen has a screen door east, west is the wooden door, and north is the exit. So to get to the Backyard, they need to go east from the Kitchen, open the screen door, then go east again. But earlier, when they tried that, they went to the Backyard but couldn't find the milk. 

So the current position is the Kitchen. The next action should be to go east to the Backyard again, open the screen door if it's closed, then check the floor for the milk. But the user might have missed it before. 

Alternatively, maybe the milk is in the Kitchen? But the original instruction said it's in the garden. The user needs to follow the steps exactly. 

So the correct next step is to go east from the Kitchen to the Backyard, then check the floor there. But the user might have to go through the screen door again. 

Therefore, the next command should be 'go east' from the Kitchen to reach the Backyard again.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Living Room, going back and forth. They've been trying to find the milk and proceed to the garden, but they're not making progress. The original goal was to lift the milk from the garden, then go north, then west, and put it on the stove. But the user hasn't found the milk yet.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Kitchen again. The refrigerator was opened earlier, but it had a tomato plant and an apple, not milk. The milk must be in the garden, but the user hasn't gone there yet. The screen door was opened earlier, leading to the Backyard, but the user hasn't gone east from the Kitchen to reach the garden.

Wait, the user tried going east from the Kitchen but was blocked until they opened the screen door. Then they went to the Backyard, but the milk is on the floor there. The user tried to lift it but the game didn't recognize the command. Maybe the correct command is "pick up milk" or "take milk from floor".

But the user has been stuck in a loop, not making progress. The score is still at 7, and they need to reach the original goal. The next step should be to go east from the Kitchen to the Backyard, then pick up the milk, then go north to the garden, then west to the stove, and put the milk there. But the user hasn't done that yet.

The current position is the Kitchen. The correct next action is to go east to the Backyard, then pick up the milk. But the user might not have tried that yet. So the answer should be to go east from the Kitchen.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to reach the goal. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the door, and gone east. They've explored the kitchen, living room, backyard, and bathroom, but haven't found the milk yet.

The original goal mentioned lifting the milk from the garden and then proceeding north. But in the current scenario, the user is in the Living Room, and the milk isn't visible there. The last action was going south, which led them back to the Living Room. The user needs to find the milk, which was supposed to be in the garden. However, the current location is the Living Room, so they need to navigate back to the garden area.

Looking at the previous steps, the user went east from the kitchen to the backyard, then west back to the kitchen. The garden might be in the backyard or another area. But in the Backyard description, there's no mention of a garden. The user might have missed the milk earlier or it's in a different location.

Wait, the original instruction said to "lift the milk from the floor of the garden." The user hasn't reached the garden yet. The current location is the Living Room, so they need to find the path to the garden. Maybe the garden is in the backyard, but the user hasn't checked there. Alternatively, maybe the milk is in the kitchen or another room.

But in the Kitchen, the refrigerator was empty, and the counter and stove were empty. The note on the kitchen island was just a note. The user might have missed the milk in an earlier step. Alternatively, maybe the milk is in the backyard, but the user hasn't checked there yet.

The user is in the Living Room, so the next step should be to go north to the kitchen again, then try to find the milk. But according to the game's current state, the milk isn't in the Living Room. The user needs to go back to the kitchen, then check the areas again. Alternatively, maybe the milk is in the backyard, so they need to go west from the Living Room to the kitchen, then east to the backyard again.

But the user's last action was going south from the kitchen to the Living Room. So the next step should be to go north back to the kitchen, then check the areas again. Alternatively, maybe the milk is in the backyard, so they need to go west from the Living Room to the kitchen, then east to the backyard again.

Wait, the user is in the Living Room, and the exit to the north is unblocked. So the next action should be to go north back to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, check the screen door east to the backyard again. The milk might be in the backyard, but the user hasn't checked there yet. So the correct next step is to go north to the kitchen, then east to the backyard, and then look for the milk.

The original goal mentioned was to lift the milk from the garden, then go north, west, and put it on the stove. But the user hasn't found the milk yet. The current location is the kitchen, and the user is moving between rooms repeatedly. 

Looking at the latest prompt, the user is in the kitchen again, and the assistant needs to decide the next action. The user's score is 7, and they've been moving between rooms without finding the milk. The note in the kitchen might be a clue, but the milk is supposed to be in the garden. 

Wait, the user was supposed to go to the garden, lift the milk, then go north and west. But in the current game state, the user is in the kitchen. Maybe they need to go back to the backyard where the milk is. The backyard has an exit to the south, which leads back to the kitchen. 

But the user hasn't found the milk yet. The milk is in the garden, which is probably the backyard. The user needs to go to the backyard, lift the milk, then go north to the kitchen, then west to the living room, and put the milk on the stove. 

However, in the current game state, the user is in the kitchen, and the last action was going north. The next step should be to go to the backyard again to find the milk. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct action would be to go south from the kitchen to the backyard, then lift the milk. 

But the user's previous attempts to go south from the kitchen led them to the living room, then back to the kitchen. Maybe they need to go west from the kitchen to the backyard. Wait, the kitchen has a wooden door leading west, which might lead to the backyard. 

So the next action should be to go west from the kitchen to the backyard, then lift the milk. But the user hasn't done that yet. The current location is the kitchen, so the next step is to go west to the backyard. 

But in the game's environment, the kitchen's west door leads to the backyard. So the correct command is "go west" to reach the backyard where the milk is. Then, once there, they can lift the milk. 

Therefore, the next action should be "go west" to the backyard to find the milk.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text adventure game, and they've been moving around different rooms. The goal seems to involve collecting items and navigating through the house. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far.

They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took an old key, used it to unlock the wooden door, and then went east to the kitchen. From there, they moved around between the kitchen, living room, backyard, and bathroom. They found some items like a tomato plant and an apple in the refrigerator but didn't use them yet. Now they're back in the living room, and the prompt asks if they're on the right track and what their next move should be.

The user's current location is the Living Room. The previous actions included going north to the kitchen, then south back to the living room. The next logical step might be to check the low table where they found a remote earlier. But the original goal mentioned lifting milk from the garden and putting it on the stove. However, the user hasn't found the milk yet. 

Wait, in the backyard, there's a patio table that's empty. Maybe the milk is there? But the user hasn't checked the backyard recently. Alternatively, they might need to go back to the kitchen and check the counter or stove. But the kitchen's counter and stove are empty. The note on the kitchen island might have clues. 

Alternatively, since they have the tomato plant and apple, maybe they need to use those in some way. But the original goal was to lift milk and put it on the stove. The user might have missed the milk in the garden. Let me check the previous steps. 

In the backyard, the user saw a patio table that's empty. The milk might be on the floor of the garden, as mentioned in the original instructions. But the user hasn't checked the garden yet. The only way to get there is through the backyard. 

So the next step should be to go east from the living room to the kitchen, then south to the backyard, check the patio table or floor for the milk. But the user is currently in the living room. The command "go north" would take them back to the kitchen, then "go south" to the backyard. But the user might need to check the backyard's patio table or floor. 

Alternatively, maybe the milk is in the kitchen. Wait, the kitchen's counter and stove are empty. The note on the kitchen island might have a clue. But the user hasn't checked that note yet. 

Wait, the original goal said: "lift the milk from the floor of the garden. If you have picked up the milk, venture north. And then, go west. And then, sit the milk on the stove." So the milk is in the garden, not the kitchen. The user needs to go to the garden, pick up the milk, then go north and west to the stove. 

But the user hasn't been to the garden yet. The garden is in the backyard. So the next step is to go east from the living room to the kitchen, then south to the backyard, check the garden area for the milk. 

But the user is currently in the living room. The next command should be "go north" to the kitchen, then "go south" to the backyard. However, the user might need to check the backyard's patio table or floor. 

Alternatively, maybe the milk is on the low table in the living room. But the user saw a lettuce and a remote there. The original goal didn't mention that. 

Wait, the user has the tomato plant and apple from the refrigerator. Maybe those are distractions. The key steps are: open the trunk, get the key, unlock the door, go east, open the screen door, go east to the backyard, lift the milk, then go north to the kitchen, west to the stove, and put the milk there. 

So the next step after the living room is to go north to the kitchen, then south to the backyard. But the user is in the living room. The correct next action is "go north" to the kitchen, then "go south" to the backyard. But the user's last action was "go south" to the living room from the kitchen. So now, from the living room, they need to go north again to the kitchen, then south to the backyard. 

But the user's last command was "go south" to the living room, so the next step is to go north back to the kitchen. Then from the kitchen, go south to the backyard. Then check the garden for the milk. 

So the next command should be "go north" to the kitchen, then "go south" to the backyard. But the user is in the living room, so the immediate next action is "go north" to the kitchen.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to reach the goal. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and gone east. They've explored the kitchen, living room, backyard, and even the bathroom. But they're stuck again, going back and forth between rooms.

The original goal mentioned was to lift the milk from the garden, then go north, west, and put it on the stove. But the user hasn't found the milk yet. The current location is the living room, and they're trying to go north again. The problem might be that they haven't found the milk in the garden. 

Looking at the previous steps, after opening the screen door and going east to the backyard, they should have been able to pick up the milk. But in the backyard description, there's no mention of milk. The user tried to lift the milk but couldn't because it wasn't there. So maybe the milk is in another location they haven't checked yet.

Wait, in the kitchen, there's a note. Maybe the milk is on the kitchen island? Or perhaps the user missed it when they were there. Alternatively, the milk could be in the backyard, but the description didn't mention it. The user might need to check the kitchen again or look for clues.

But according to the game's feedback, the user is stuck in a loop. The score is low, and they haven't completed the required steps. The next logical step would be to check the kitchen island for the milk, but the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, maybe the milk is in the living room, but the description says there's a lettuce on the couch and a remote on the table. 

Wait, the original instructions said to lift the milk from the garden. The garden might be the backyard. But in the backyard, the user saw a patio table and chairs, but no milk. Maybe the milk is on the kitchen island? The user took the tomato plant and apple from the refrigerator, but not the milk. 

Hmm, perhaps the user needs to go back to the kitchen and check the kitchen island again. The note there might be a clue. Alternatively, the milk could be in the bathroom, but the bathroom only has a toilet and a sink with a toothbrush. 

The user is currently in the living room, trying to go north again. The next step should be to check the kitchen again for the milk. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct action would be to go back to the kitchen and look for the milk there. However, the user's last action was going north, which led them back to the kitchen. Maybe they need to check the kitchen island again.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Living Room, going back and forth. They've been trying to find the milk and proceed further. But in the current scenario, they're in the Kitchen again, and the previous attempts to find the milk didn't work. The user might not realize that the milk is in the garden or another location.

Looking at the history, the user was told to "lift the milk from the floor of the garden" but couldn't find it. However, in the current room (Kitchen), there's no mention of milk. The user might have missed it earlier or not checked the right place. Since the user is repeatedly going between rooms without progress, maybe they need to check other locations or follow a different path.

The original goal was to reach the garden, pick up the milk, then go north and west, and sit the milk on the stove. But the user hasn't successfully found the milk yet. Maybe the milk is in the garden, which is accessible via the screen door in the Kitchen. The user tried going east but was told to open the screen door first. They did open it, but then ended up in the Backyard, which doesn't have the milk.

Wait, in the Backyard, there's a patio table, but no milk. The user might have missed the milk in the garden when they were in the Living Room. Alternatively, maybe the milk is in the Kitchen, but the user didn't check there. However, the Kitchen's description doesn't mention milk. The user might need to check the stove or counter again.

Alternatively, the user might have to go back to the Bedroom, check the antique trunk again, but it was empty. The only thing left is the note on the kitchen island. Maybe the milk is in the garden, but the user hasn't checked there properly. The user needs to go to the garden, check the floor, and pick it up. But in the current state, they're stuck in the Kitchen, so the next step should be to go east again to the Backyard and check the garden area.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a TextWorld game, and they've been moving around different rooms. The original goal mentioned in the setup was to recover the old key, unlock the door, and then proceed to the garden, pick up the milk, and so on. But the user has been stuck in a loop between the Kitchen, Living Room, and Backyard, not making progress towards the original goal.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Backyard. The previous actions involved going back and forth between rooms without achieving the necessary steps. The key steps from the initial instructions were: open the antique trunk, get the old key, unlock the door, go east, check the screen door, go east again, then try to pick up the milk in the garden. However, the user hasn't managed to reach the garden yet.

In the current scenario, the user is in the Backyard, but there's no mention of the milk being there. The original instruction said to "lift the milk from the floor of the garden," which suggests that the milk is in the garden, not the backyard. The user might have missed the correct path to the garden.

Looking at the room descriptions, the Backyard has a patio table and chairs, but no milk. The Kitchen and Living Room don't mention the garden. The user needs to find the correct path to the garden. Maybe the garden is through the screen door in the Kitchen or another room. But the user has been going back and forth without finding it.

The user's score is stuck at 7, which might indicate that they haven't completed the necessary steps. The key steps are still pending: getting the milk, then going north to the stove, etc. Since the user is in the Backyard, maybe they need to go south to return to the Kitchen and then find the correct exit to the garden.

But the user has tried going south from the Backyard and ended up back in the Kitchen. The Kitchen has an exit to the north, but that's not helpful. The user needs to find the garden, which might be through a different door or path. However, in the current room descriptions, the garden isn't mentioned. Maybe the garden is part of the Backyard, but the milk is on the floor there. But the user hasn't found it yet.

Alternatively, maybe the milk is in the Kitchen or another room. The user has been picking up items like the tomato plant and apple, but not the milk. The original instruction said to "lift the milk from the floor of the garden," so the milk must be in the garden, not the Backyard.

The user might need to find the garden through a different route. Perhaps the garden is accessible from the Kitchen via the screen door east, but the user hasn't checked that. However, in the current state, the user is in the Backyard, so they need to go back to the Kitchen and then try the screen door again.

But the user's last action was going west from the Backyard, which led them back to the Kitchen. From there, they need to go east through the screen door to reach the garden. However, in the Kitchen description, the screen door is open, so that's the correct path. The user might have missed that earlier.

So the next step should be to go east from the Kitchen through the screen door to reach the garden where the milk is. But the user is currently in the Backyard, so they need to go back to the Kitchen and then east. However, the user's current position is the Backyard, so they need to go south to the Kitchen again and then east to the garden.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Garden now. The prompt mentions there's a half of a bag of chips, a milk, a bell pepper, and a shovel on the floor. The original goal was to lift the milk from the garden, then go north, then west, and sit the milk on the stove.

Wait, the user had previously tried to lift the milk but couldn't because they were in the Living Room. Now they're in the Garden, which has the milk on the floor. So the next step should be to pick up the milk here. The score increased by one, so maybe that's part of the progression.

The user's next action should be to lift the milk. The command would be "lift milk from floor" or "take milk". But in the previous attempt, the user tried "lift milk from floor of backyard" which wasn't recognized. Now, since they're in the Garden, maybe the correct command is just "lift milk" or "take milk".

Looking at the environment description, the milk is on the floor of the garden. So the correct command is likely "lift milk from floor" but the system might accept "take milk" if that's the correct verb. However, in the previous interaction, "lift milk from floor" was not recognized. But in the current context, the milk is in the Garden, so maybe the correct command is "lift milk".

Alternatively, the user might need to specify the location, like "lift milk from floor of garden". But the game's previous responses might have varying syntax. Since the user is in the Garden, and the milk is on the floor, the correct action is to pick it up. The previous error was because the user mentioned "backyard", but now they're in the Garden. So the correct command is "lift milk".
