Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! First, it would be fantastic if you could ensure that the chest drawer is open. After that, recover the old key from the chest drawer. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. And then, head east. And then, make absolutely sure that the screen door within the kitchen is wide open. After that, make an effort to go to the east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to go south. With that accomplished, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After that, try to venture north. Then, make an attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove within the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
I am excited to announce that you are now in the bedroom.

You see a closed chest drawer. You can make out an antique trunk. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can make out a king-size bed! But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the king-size bed.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been following a set of steps to complete certain tasks. The current situation is in the Kitchen, and they tried to go east but were told they need to open the screen door first.

First, I need to recall the previous steps. The user had to open the chest drawer, get the old key, unlock and open the wooden door in the bedroom, then go east to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, there's a closed screen door leading east. The user attempted to go east but was blocked. The next logical step is to open the screen door.

The user's question is whether they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. Considering the tasks listed initially, the next steps after entering the kitchen were to make sure the screen door is open, then go east, then south, etc. So opening the screen door is part of the plan. The user might be confused if they think they're not making progress, but actually, each step is part of the sequence.

The correct action here is to open the screen door. The user tried "go east" but was told to open the door first. So the next command should be "open screen door".

<think>
Okay, the user is stuck on the "pick up milk from floor of garden" command. They've tried multiple variations, but the system keeps only understanding the part about picking up the milk. The user is asking if they're on the right track and needs the next action.

First, I need to check the game's current state. The user is in the Garden, where there's a milk on the floor. The previous attempts to pick up the milk aren't working. The correct command should be "pick up milk" or "take milk". Maybe the game expects a simpler command without "from floor of garden".

The user's goal is to lift the milk, so the next step is to use the correct verb phrase. Since "pick up" is the main action, perhaps "pick up milk" is the right command. The system might not accept the more detailed version, so simplifying it could work.

Also, the user is asking if they're close to the goal. So far, they've completed most steps: opened the chest, got the key, unlocked and opened the door, went east to kitchen, opened screen door, went east to backyard, south to garden. Now they need to pick up the milk. Once that's done, they need to go north, then west, then rest the milk on the stove. So the next action after picking up the milk is to go north.

But the user is stuck on the milk command. So the immediate next action should be to try "pick up milk" again, as that's the correct verb. If that fails, maybe "take milk" or "get milk". But based on previous interactions, "pick up" is the correct verb. So the answer should be "pick up milk".

Okay, the user is stuck in the Garden scene, repeatedly trying to pick up the milk. The game's response indicates that "pick up milk from floor of garden" isn't recognized. Let me check the possible correct command.

Looking at the game's previous interactions, when the user tried "lift milk from floor of garden", the system corrected it to "pick up". But the user keeps using "pick up milk from floor of garden", which the system still doesn't recognize. Wait, maybe the correct command is just "pick up milk" without specifying the floor? Or maybe "take milk from floor"?

Alternatively, the game might expect a more concise command. Let me check the available verbs. The user has already picked up the milk, but the system is not acknowledging it. Wait, the user's last action was "pick up milk from floor of garden", but the system says it's not understood. Maybe the correct command is "take milk from floor" or "get milk".

But the user is trying to follow the instructions step by step. The original goal was to lift the milk from the garden floor. The system might be expecting a different phrasing. Let me think of possible variations: "pick milk up from floor", "get milk from floor", "take milk from floor of garden".

Alternatively, maybe the game is case-sensitive, so "Pick up milk from floor of garden" with capital letters. But the user has been using lowercase. Alternatively, the game might require "pick up milk" without specifying the floor, assuming it's in the garden.

Wait, the user is in the Garden scene, so maybe just "pick up milk" is sufficient. The system might have a typo in the feedback, but the user needs to try a different phrasing. Let me check the previous correct command. Earlier, when the user tried "pick up milk from floor of garden", the system said it wasn't understood. But maybe the correct command is "pick up milk" without the floor part. Let me try that.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've been following a series of steps to complete tasks. The original goal was to go through a series of rooms, open things, collect items, and eventually reach the end. 

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Living Room. The score is at 9/14. The previous actions involved moving through different rooms, opening doors, picking up the milk, and now they're here. The next step mentioned in the original instructions was to "rest the milk on the stove within the kitchen." But the user hasn't done that yet.

Wait, the user picked up the milk in the garden and then went back to the kitchen. Now they're in the living room. The stove is in the kitchen, which is east of the living room. So the next logical step would be to go back to the kitchen, put the milk on the stove. But the current location is the living room, so the user needs to go north to exit the living room and get back to the kitchen. But the living room's exit is north, which leads to the bedroom? Wait, no. Let me check the previous moves.

Earlier, the user went from the garden to the backyard, then to the kitchen, then back to the backyard, then to the garden, picked up the milk, then went back to the kitchen, then to the living room. So the living room's exit is north, which might lead back to the bedroom or another area. But the goal is to rest the milk on the stove in the kitchen. So the user needs to go back to the kitchen, then put the milk on the stove. But currently, they're in the living room. So the next step should be to go north from the living room to get back to the kitchen. Wait, but the living room's exit is north, which might be the bedroom. Wait, maybe the user needs to go south from the living room to get back to the kitchen? Wait, the living room's description says "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north." So the exit is north. But the kitchen is east of the living room? Or west?

Wait, the user was in the kitchen, then went south to the backyard, then went west to the kitchen again. Then from the kitchen, they went south again to the backyard, then went east to the garden, then north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen, then south to the living room. So the living room is connected to the kitchen via the north exit? Or maybe the living room is connected to the bedroom. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. But according to the current room description, the living room has an exit to the north. So the user needs to go north from the living room to proceed. But the original goal was to rest the milk on the stove in the kitchen. So maybe after getting back to the kitchen, the user can put the milk on the stove. But the user is currently in the living room, so the next step is to go north to exit the living room and get back to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, put the milk on the stove. That would be the next action. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next step is to go north from the living room to reach the kitchen again, then put the milk on the stove. But the user is in the living room now, so the immediate next action is to go north.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete a task. The original goal was to perform a series of actions starting from the bedroom, moving through various rooms, and eventually completing tasks like lifting the milk and resting it on the stove.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Living Room, and the score is at 9/20. The previous actions involved moving between rooms, opening doors, picking up the milk in the garden, and moving back and forth between the kitchen, backyard, and living room. The user has been repeatedly trying to pick up the milk, but the system is not recognizing the command correctly. After finally picking up the milk, they went north and south again, cycling through the same rooms.

Now, the user is asked if they think they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. The next action should be to rest the milk on the stove in the kitchen. Since the last move was going north from the Living Room back to the Kitchen, the next logical step is to go to the kitchen again, then find the stove and place the milk there. However, the user might have already done that, but based on the score, they need to continue progressing.

Wait, in the Garden, after picking up the milk, the next step was to go north, which took them back to the Backyard, then to the Kitchen. The original instruction said to "rest the milk on the stove within the kitchen." So the user needs to go to the kitchen, find the stove, and put the milk there. But in the current state, they're in the Living Room again. So the next action should be to go north back to the Kitchen, then interact with the stove. However, the user might have already done that, but the score hasn't increased, so maybe they need to explicitly put the milk on the stove.

But the user's last action was going north from the Living Room, which brings them back to the Kitchen. So the next step is to go to the stove and rest the milk. The command would be "put milk on stove" or something similar. However, the game's commands are limited, and the user has to use the exact verbs. Since the previous actions involved "pick up milk," the next step would be "put milk on stove."

But the user is in the Kitchen now, so the correct command would be "put milk on stove." However, the user might need to first go to the stove's location. But in the Kitchen description, there's a stove mentioned. So the user should go to the stove and then put the milk there. However, the user is currently in the Living Room, so they need to go north to the Kitchen again, then go to the stove.

Wait, the user is in the Living Room, and the next action is to go north to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, they can interact with the stove. So the next command is "go north" to get back to the Kitchen, then "put milk on stove."

But the user's last action was "go north" from the Living Room, which took them to the Kitchen. So the next step is to put the milk on the stove. However, the user might need to check if the stove is accessible. In the Kitchen description, the stove is mentioned as being revealed when the wall is pressed, but it's already open. So the user can go to the stove and put the milk there.

Therefore, the next action should be "put milk on stove" in the Kitchen. But the user is in the Kitchen now, so the correct command is "put milk on stove." However, the user might need to first go to the stove's location. But in the Kitchen, the stove is part of the environment, so the command should be straightforward.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to put the milk on the stove in the kitchen, but they're in the Living Room now. The milk was picked up in the Garden, and they've been moving around between rooms. The problem is that the stove is in the Kitchen, which is a different room. The user is currently in the Living Room, so they need to go back to the Kitchen first. The correct action would be to go north to return to the Kitchen where the stove is located. Then they can attempt to put the milk on the stove. But since the user is in the Living Room, the next step should be to go north to the Kitchen.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete a task. The goal seems to involve moving through different rooms, opening doors, retrieving items, and finally placing the milk on the stove in the kitchen.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Kitchen again, and the score is at 9/25. The previous attempts to put the milk on the stove failed because the user was in the Living Room, and the milk was in the Garden. The user had to navigate back to the Kitchen to do that. However, the current location is the Kitchen, so maybe the milk is already here? Wait, no—the milk was picked up in the Garden and then the user tried to put it on the stove in the Kitchen but couldn't because they were in the Living Room. Now, after moving back to the Kitchen, the user should be able to put the milk on the stove here.

But the system message says "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the stove isn't visible, or the milk isn't in the Kitchen. Wait, the user picked up the milk in the Garden, so they have it. The stove is in the Kitchen, so the user needs to put the milk on the stove here. The previous attempt was in the Living Room, which is why it didn't work. Now, in the Kitchen, the user should be able to do that. So the correct command would be "put milk on stove" or "put milk on stove in kitchen". But the system is rejecting it, so maybe the correct syntax is just "put milk on stove" since the user is in the Kitchen where the stove is located. Alternatively, maybe the stove is part of the kitchen island or the counter. The description mentions a stove revealed by pressing a button, but the user hasn't interacted with that yet. However, the user is already in the Kitchen, so the stove should be accessible.

The user's last action was "go north" to the Kitchen, so they are now in the Kitchen. The next step is to put the milk on the stove. The correct command should be "put milk on stove" without specifying the kitchen again because the user is already there. The system might be rejecting it because the stove isn't visible, but according to the earlier description, the stove is there. So the user should try "put milk on stove".
