Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to open the chest drawer in the bedroom. After that, pick up the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, look and see that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. Then, open the wooden door inside the bedroom. After that, make an effort to move east. And then, go to the south. And then, recover the half of a bag of chips from the couch. Once you have got the half of a bag of chips, go north. With that over with, put the half of a bag of chips on the stove. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in the bedroom. Let's see what's in here.

You can see a closed chest drawer. You make out an antique trunk. You see a king-size bed. You shudder, but continue examining the king-size bed. The king-size bed is ordinary. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.

Oh, great. Here's a refrigerator. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? The counter is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove. Were you looking for a kitchen island? Because look over there, it's a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Living Room =-
You find yourself in a living room. An ordinary one. You begin looking for stuff.

You see a couch. You see a half of a bag of chips on the couch, so there's that. You can see a low table. You see a remote on the low table. You scan the room for a tv, and you find a tv. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game and has followed a series of steps. The goal is to open the chest drawer, pick up the key, unlock and open the door, go east, then south, retrieve the chips, put them on the stove, and win.

So far, they've opened the chest drawer, picked up the key, tried to open the door but needed to unlock it. They unlocked it, went east to the kitchen, then south to the living room. Now they're in the living room, where they found the half bag of chips. The next step according to the original instructions was to pick up the chips, then go north to the stove. Wait, but in the current state, they're in the living room, which is south of the kitchen. The kitchen's north exit would lead back to the bedroom, but the living room has an exit to the north. Wait, the living room's north exit is unblocked. But the stove is in the kitchen. Wait, the user needs to go north from the living room to reach the kitchen again? Or maybe the stove is in the kitchen, so after getting the chips in the living room, they need to go back to the kitchen to put them on the stove.

Wait, the original plan was: after getting the chips in the living room, go north (which would be back to the kitchen?), then put the chips on the stove. But in the current state, the user is in the living room. So the next step is to pick up the half bag of chips. The user has already done that? Wait, in the living room description, it says "You see a half of a bag of chips on the couch, so there's that." So the user needs to pick it up. Then, go north to the kitchen, then put it on the stove.

But the user's last action was "go south" which led them to the living room. Now, in the living room, they need to pick up the chips. So the next command should be "pick up half of a bag of chips" or "take half of a bag of chips". Then, go north to the kitchen. Then, put the chips on the stove. Then win.

But the user's current prompt says "Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?" So they're asking if the steps so far are correct. The user has already done the steps up to the living room, picked up the chips. Then, the next step is to go north to the kitchen, then put the chips on the stove. So the next action after being in the living room is to pick up the chips. But in the current state, the user is in the living room, and the chips are on the couch. So the next command should be "pick up half of a bag of chips". Then go north to the kitchen. Then put the chips on the stove. Then win.
