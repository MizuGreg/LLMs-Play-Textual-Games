I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar. After opening the wooden door, go east. Then, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. And then, attempt to travel east. And then, try to travel south. With that done, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After stealing the milk, head north. And then, attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You think about smashing the king-size bed to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me see. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld. Their task is to follow a series of steps to complete the game. So far, they've opened an antique trunk, taken an old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. The current score is 4 out of 6.

The user's next step, according to the original instructions, is to go east after opening the wooden door. But the user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. They also want to know the next action.

Looking at the current state: the wooden door is open (since they just opened it), and the next step is to go east. The user has to move east, then check the screen door, then go east again, then south, etc. So the immediate next action should be to go east. But the user is asking for confirmation, so maybe they need to proceed with that step.

But the user's last input was "open wooden door" which succeeded. Now the next step is to go east. The user's question is whether they're on the right path. Since they've completed the steps up to opening the door, it's correct. So the next command should be "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
Of every kitchen you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what the next step should be. The user is in the Kitchen room after opening the wooden door from the bedroom. The original goal was to follow a series of steps: open the trunk, get the key, unlock the door, open it, go east, check the screen door, go east again, try south, then go to the garden, lift milk, etc.

So far, the user has opened the screen door (east) and is now in the Kitchen. The next step according to the original instructions was after opening the wooden door (which they did), go east. Then double-check the screen door is open, then travel east again, then try south. But in the current state, the user is in the Kitchen, and the screen door is closed. Wait, no: when they went east from the bedroom, they encountered the screen door leading east, which is closed. Then the user tried to go east but had to open it. But in the current state, after opening the screen door, they are in the Kitchen. Wait, maybe the user is confused.

Wait, the user's last action was "go east" from the bedroom, which led them to the Kitchen. But the screen door is closed. The user tried to go east again, but the screen door is closed. However, in the current room (Kitchen), the screen door is closed. So the next step is to open the screen door. But the user is in the Kitchen, and the screen door is leading east. Wait, no: in the Kitchen, the screen door is leading east. So the user is in the Kitchen, and the screen door is closed. The original instruction was to double-check that the screen door is wide open. So the user needs to open it.

But the user is in the Kitchen, and the screen door is closed. So the next action should be to open the screen door. But the user has to use the correct command. The available commands include "open screen door". So the next step is to open the screen door. Then, after opening it, they can go east again. Then, according to the original plan, after going east, they need to try to travel south. But maybe the user is supposed to check the screen door first.

Wait, the original steps after opening the wooden door (bedroom) were: go east, then double-check screen door is open, then travel east, then try south. So in the Kitchen, the screen door is closed. So the user needs to open it. So the next command should be "open screen door".

You find yourself in a backyard. An ordinary one. Let's see what's in here.

You can see a set of chairs. The set of chairs is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the set of chairs. You make out a bbq. The bbq is usual. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well You can see a patio table. However, the patio table, like an empty patio table, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

You find yourself in a backyard. An ordinary one. Let's see what's in here.

You can see a set of chairs. The set of chairs is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the set of chairs. You make out a bbq. The bbq is usual. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well You can see a patio table. However, the patio table, like an empty patio table, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what the next step should be. The user is in the Backyard, which is a room they entered after going east from the Kitchen. The original goal was to lift the milk from the garden, then head north, then go west, then rest the milk on the stove.

Wait, the user's current location is the Backyard. The original steps after going east from the Kitchen were: double-check screen door is open (which they did), then travel east again. But in the Backyard, the screen door is west. So maybe they need to check if the milk is here. But the Backyard has chairs, a bbq, a patio table—nothing mentioned about milk. The user's next step was supposed to be trying to travel south from the Backyard. The exit to the south is unguarded. So maybe the next action is to go south. But the user's task was to lift the milk from the garden. Wait, maybe the garden is a different room. The user might have missed the garden. Alternatively, maybe the milk is in the Backyard. But the description says the patio table is empty. Hmm.

Wait, the original instructions said: "lift the milk from the floor of the garden." So the garden is a separate room. The user is in the Backyard, which is adjacent to the garden? Or maybe the garden is south of the Backyard. The Backyard has an exit to the south. So the user should go south to the garden, find the milk, lift it, then head north back to the Backyard, then go west to the Kitchen, then rest the milk on the stove.

So the next step is to go south from the Backyard. The exit to the south is unguarded, so the user can go there. That's the next logical step.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Garden room. The original goal was to lift the milk from the floor of the garden. The user just took the milk from the floor, but the system said they can't see any such thing. Wait, maybe the command was "take milk from floor" but the correct command is "take milk". Because the milk is on the floor, so the correct command would be "take milk" without specifying "from floor" since it's already on the floor.

So the next step is to take the milk. The user tried "take milk from floor" but it didn't work. The correct command is just "take milk". Then, after taking the milk, they need to head north to the Backyard, then go west to the Kitchen, then rest the milk on the stove. So the next action should be "take milk".

Of every kitchen you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has completed most of the steps up to now. They took the milk from the garden, went back to the kitchen, and are now in the kitchen. The next step according to the original plan was to rest the milk on the stove. So the user needs to place the milk on the stove. The command for that would be "put milk on stove". Let me check if that's the correct command. The available commands include "put ... on ...", so yes, that's the right syntax. The user has the milk in their inventory now, so they can put it on the stove. That should complete the task.
</think>put milk on stove
