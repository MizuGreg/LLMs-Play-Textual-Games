Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to open the chest drawer within the bedroom. After that, recover the old key from the chest drawer. Then, unlock the wooden door within the bedroom. And then, assure that the wooden door is ajar. After opening the wooden door, attempt to move east. Then, make sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is ajar. After pulling open the screen door, take a trip east. Following that, make an effort to venture south. With that accomplished, pick up the milk from the floor of the garden. Then, head north. Next, try to go west. With that accomplished, rest the milk on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A standard one.

Were you looking for a chest drawer? Because look over there, it's a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. Look over there! a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, but couldn't push it open. The game's current state is in the bedroom, and the wooden door is east.

The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to winning. They also want the next action. Let me check the previous steps again. The user tried to push the wooden door open but got a message saying they can't see any such thing. That might mean that the door isn't in a position where pushing it is possible. Maybe the door is already open, or they need to use the key again?

Wait, the user already unlocked the door with the key. Maybe the next step is to open it fully. But the game says they can't push it. Alternatively, maybe the door is ajar, and they need to check if it's open. But the original goal was to assure the door is ajar. Wait, the initial steps were: open the chest drawer, get the key, unlock the door, make sure it's ajar. So maybe after unlocking, they need to open it manually. But the game says they can't push it. Maybe the door is locked, but they already unlocked it. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the door is ajar, and the user needs to check that. But the user's last action was trying to push it, which didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to open the door instead of pushing. Or perhaps the door is already open, and the user needs to move east through it. But the game's message says they can't see any such thing, so maybe the door is not in the right state.

Wait, the user's next step after unlocking the door was to "assure that the wooden door is ajar." So maybe they need to check if it's open. But the game's response says they can't push it. Maybe the door is already open, and the user needs to move east. But the user's next action was to push it, which didn't work. So maybe the correct action is to go east through the door. But the game's message says they can't see any such thing. Maybe the door is open, and the user needs to move east. But the user is in the bedroom, and the door is east. So maybe the next step is to go east. But the user tried to push the door, which didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to go east, but the door is already open. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to open the door first.

Wait, the user's previous action was unlocking the door. The game says "You unlock wooden door." Then the next step was to push it open, which failed. So maybe the door is unlocked but not open. The user needs to open it. But the game's message says they can't push it. Maybe the correct action is to open the door instead of pushing. But in the game's context, the user might need to use the key again. Wait, but the key was already used to unlock it. Maybe the door is now open, and the user can move east. But the game's message says they can't see any such thing. Maybe the user needs to check if the door is open. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to open the door by moving east, but the door is locked. But the user already unlocked it. This is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to move east through the door once it's open. But the game's message says they can't see any such thing. Maybe the user is supposed to try to go east again. Let me check the original instructions. The user's goal was to open the chest drawer, get the key, unlock the door, make sure it's ajar, then move east. So after unlocking, the next step is to ensure the door is open. But the user tried to push it, which didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to go east now, assuming the door is open. But the game's message says they can't see any such thing. Maybe the user needs to open the door first. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the user should check if the door is open. The game's message says they can't push it, so maybe the door is already open. Then the next step is to move east. But the user is in the bedroom, and the door is east. So the next action should be to go east. But the game's message says they can't see any such thing. Maybe the user is supposed to try to go east again. But the user's previous action was pushing the door, which didn't work. So maybe the correct next action is to go east, even though the door is unlocked. Maybe the game is expecting the user to move east through the door. So the next action should be "go east".

You are in a kitchen. A typical one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You see a refrigerator. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is usual. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a stove. The stove is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the kitchen now. The previous steps were opening the wooden door in the bedroom, which led them here. The current goal is to make sure the screen door in the kitchen is ajar. The user's next action should be to open the screen door.

Looking at the environment description, there's a closed screen door leading east. The user needs to open it. The game's message mentions that after pulling open the screen door, they should take a trip east. So the next step is to open the screen door. The correct command would be "open screen door" or "pull screen door open". But in the game's context, the exact phrasing might matter. Since the user previously used "push wooden door open", maybe the correct action here is "open screen door". But the game might expect "pull" instead. However, the user's previous action was "push", so maybe "open" is acceptable. Alternatively, the game might have specific commands. But given the previous steps, the user should try opening the screen door. So the next action is "open screen door".

Okay, let's see. The user is in the garden now. The previous steps were moving south from the backyard to the garden. The current goal is to pick up the milk from the floor of the garden. The user's next action should be to pick up the milk.

Looking at the environment description, there's a milk on the floor. The user needs to take it. The correct command would be "take milk". Since the user has to pick up the milk, that's the next step. The game's score is increasing, so the user is on track. The next action is to take the milk.

Okay, the user is in the garden and needs to pick up the milk from the floor. They've tried "take milk from floor" and "pick up milk from floor", but both resulted in "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the correct command is different. Let me check the environment again.

The garden has a lettuce, a milk, a half of a bag of chips, and a shovel on the floor. The user needs to take the milk. The possible commands could be "take milk" without specifying the floor, or maybe "take milk from floor". But the game says "can't see any such thing" for those. Maybe the milk is not on the floor but somewhere else? Wait, the description says "on the floor", so the user should be able to take it. Maybe the correct command is just "take milk". Let me try that.

Alternatively, maybe the game expects "take milk" without the "from floor" part. The user tried "take milk from floor" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "take milk". Let me check the previous steps. The user's last action was "pick up milk from floor", which didn't work. So maybe the correct command is "take milk". Let me try that.

Okay, the user is in the bathroom now. The previous steps led them here by going north from the kitchen. The original goal was to "rest the milk on the stove" after picking up the milk. But the user hasn't reached that step yet. Let me check the current location and possible actions.

The bathroom has a toilet, a bath, a sink with a toothbrush, and an exit south. The user needs to continue following the original plan. The last step before resting the milk on the stove was heading north, but that led to the bathroom. Maybe the user needs to go south back to the kitchen and then find the stove. But the original plan said after picking up the milk, head north, then try to go west. Wait, the user's steps so far were: bedroom -> kitchen -> backyard -> garden -> backyard -> kitchen -> bathroom. Maybe they need to go south from the bathroom back to the kitchen, then find the stove to rest the milk. But the original goal was to rest the milk on the stove. So the next action should be to go south from the bathroom to return to the kitchen, then go to the stove. But the user is in the bathroom, so the next command is "go south".

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the kitchen and bathroom. They need to rest the milk on the stove, but they're not getting anywhere. Let me think about the original plan. After picking up the milk in the garden, the next steps were to head north, then try to go west. But that led them to the bathroom. Maybe they need to go back to the kitchen and then find the stove. The milk is already picked up, so the next step is to go to the stove. But in the kitchen, the stove is empty. Maybe the user needs to go to the kitchen island where there's a note. Alternatively, maybe they need to go east through the screen door. Wait, the original goal said after moving east from the kitchen, venture south. But the user is going back and forth. Maybe the correct path is to go east from the kitchen, then south. Let me check the kitchen's description again. The kitchen has an open screen door east and a open wooden door west. The user is in the kitchen, so going east would be the next step. Then, after going east, they need to venture south. But the user is currently in the kitchen, so the next action should be to go east.
</think>go east

You can't go that way.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A typical one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You see a refrigerator. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is usual. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a stove. The stove is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, the user is back in the kitchen. They need to rest the milk on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, but it's empty. The user has the milk, so they need to place it on the stove. The correct command would be "put milk on stove". Let me check if that's the right action. The previous steps were going back and forth, but the goal is to put the milk on the stove. So the next action should be to put the milk there.
