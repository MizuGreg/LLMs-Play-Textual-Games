It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to make absolutely sure that the antique trunk is opened. And then, take the old key from the antique trunk within the bedroom. After that, check that the wooden door within the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. After that, look and see that the wooden door is open. After that, try to move east. After that, open the screen door in the kitchen. And then, venture east. Then, attempt to travel south. And then, lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden. If you have picked up the lettuce, travel north. And then, try to move west. Then, rest the lettuce on the stove. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
I am excited to announce that you are now in the bedroom. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a chest drawer. Hmm. You always thought you'd be more excited to see a chest drawer in a room. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to an antique trunk. You can make out a king-size bed. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has followed a series of steps to progress. They've opened the antique trunk, taken the key, unlocked and opened the bedroom door, gone east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden. Now they're in the garden, which has a lettuce on the floor.

The original goal was to pick up the lettuce, then travel north, then west, rest the lettuce on the stove, and win. The user has already picked up the lettuce, right? Wait, the current step is in the garden, and the lettuce is on the floor. So the next action should be to pick up the lettuce. Then, after picking it up, they need to travel north. Then west, then put the lettuce on the stove. But the user's last action was going south to the garden, and now they're at the garden. So the next step is to pick up the lettuce. Let me check the current state again.

In the garden, the items on the floor are milk, apple, lettuce, and shovel. So the user needs to take the lettuce. Once they have it, they need to go north, then west. Then put the lettuce on the stove. But the stove is in the kitchen, so they would have to go back through the kitchen, then to the backyard, then to the kitchen again? Wait, the previous steps: they were in the garden, so after picking up the lettuce, they need to go north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen, then maybe south to the kitchen again? Wait, the kitchen's screen door was opened earlier, and the user was in the backyard, then went south to the garden. Now, in the garden, after picking up the lettuce, they need to go north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can put the lettuce on the stove. Then, the game is won.

So the next action here is to pick up the lettuce. The user is in the garden, and the lettuce is on the floor. So the command should be "take lettuce from floor" or something similar. But in the game's context, the correct command would be "take lettuce". Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to "lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden. If you have picked up the lettuce, travel north." So the next action after being in the garden is to take the lettuce. So the correct command here is "take lettuce".

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a sequence of actions in this text-based game. Their goal is to open the antique trunk, take the old key, unlock and open the bedroom door, move east to the kitchen, open the screen door, go east again to the backyard, then south to the garden. In the garden, they need to pick up the lettuce, then go north, west, rest the lettuce on the stove, and finally win.

So far, they've managed to get to the garden, but when they tried to take the lettuce, it didn't work. The message says "You can't see any such thing." Wait, but the garden description mentions there's a lettuce on the floor. Maybe the command isn't phrased correctly. The user tried "take lettuce from floor," but maybe the correct command is just "take lettuce" or "take the lettuce." The game might be expecting a different syntax. Also, the user's score is still at 8/11, so they haven't completed all the steps yet.

Next, after picking up the lettuce, they need to go north to the backyard again, then west to the kitchen, then south to the garden again. But since they're stuck at the garden, they need to figure out how to pick up the lettuce. Maybe the lettuce is already in their inventory, but the game isn't recognizing it. Alternatively, maybe they need to interact with the floor or another object to pick it up. Alternatively, perhaps the correct command is "pick up lettuce" instead of "take lettuce from floor." The user might need to try a different command structure. Since the game's previous responses were case-sensitive or required specific phrasing, the user should try varying the command slightly. For example, "take lettuce" without specifying the floor, or "get lettuce." But the user's last attempt was "take lettuce from floor," which didn't work. So maybe the correct command is just "take lettuce." Let me check the previous steps again. The user was in the garden, and the description says there's a lettuce on the floor. So the correct command should be "take lettuce" or "take the lettuce." The user might have used the wrong phrasing by including "from floor," which the game might not accept. So the next action should be to try "take lettuce" without the "from floor" part. That's the most likely issue here. The user needs to try that command again.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to rest the lettuce on the stove. The previous command was "rest lettuce on stove", but the system said that's not a recognized verb. So I need to figure out the correct command.

First, the user has the lettuce in their inventory, as they picked it up from the garden. The goal is to rest the lettuce on the stove. But the game might not use the word "rest" directly. Maybe the correct action is to put the lettuce on the stove. Let me check the possible verbs. In TextWorld, common verbs are "put", "place", "rest", etc. But "rest" might not be valid here. The system rejected "rest", so maybe the correct verb is "put".

So the correct command should be "put lettuce on stove". Let me confirm. The user is in the kitchen, and the stove is present. So the action is to put the lettuce on the stove. That should be the next step. Then, after that, the user wins. So the next action is "put lettuce on stove".
