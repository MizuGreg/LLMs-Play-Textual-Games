Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be great if you could assure that the chest drawer is ajar. Then, take the old key from the chest drawer. If you can get your hands on the old key, unlock the wooden door. And then, make it so that the wooden door is ajar. And then, move east. With that over with, ensure that the screen door is open. And then, make an attempt to move east. Next, go to the south. After that, lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden. After that, go north. Okay, and then, venture west. That done, rest the lettuce on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an antique trunk, so there's that. You scan the room, seeing a king-size bed. The king-size bed is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and tried to go east. But the game keeps saying they need to open the wooden door first. Wait, maybe the door is already unlocked but not open? The user tried to unlock it again, but the system said it's already unlocked. Hmm.

The original goal was to get the key, unlock the door, make it ajar, move east, then go south, pick up lettuce, etc. So maybe after unlocking, they need to open the door. The user tried going east before opening it, which was incorrect. The next step should be to open the door after unlocking. But the game's response said "That's unlocked at the moment," so maybe the door is unlocked but not open. So the correct action would be to open the door. Then proceed east. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user had already unlocked the door, but perhaps "unlock" and "open" are different actions here. The door might be unlocked but still closed. So the next step is to open the door. Then go east. Let me make sure. The user's last action was trying to go east again, but the game said they need to open the door first. So the correct next action is to open the wooden door. Then go east. So the next command should be "open wooden door".

You've come into an ordinary room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be ordinary. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You make out a refrigerator. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove appears to be empty. You move on, clearly infuriated by TextWorld. You scan the room for a kitchen island, and you find a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Garden scene. They need to lift the lettuce from the floor. The previous attempt was "lift lettuce from floor", but the game said that's not a recognized verb. Then the user tried "pick up lettuce from floor", which the game partially understood. Now, the user is asking if they're on the right track and needs the next action.

The original goal was to pick up the lettuce, then go north, then venture west, rest the lettuce on the stove. So far, the user has opened the chest, gotten the key, unlocked the door, opened the door, went east to kitchen, opened screen door, went east to backyard, south to garden. Now in the garden, they need to pick up the lettuce. The correct verb here is likely "take" or "pick up". Since "pick up" was partially understood, maybe the game expects "take lettuce" or "pick up lettuce". But the user tried "pick up lettuce from floor" and the game said it wasn't understood. Maybe the correct command is just "take lettuce" without specifying the floor. Alternatively, the game might require "pick up lettuce". Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "pick up lettuce from floor" and the game said it was partially understood. So maybe the correct command is "pick up lettuce". Let me try that.

Now they're in the backyard again, and the goal was to rest the lettuce on the stove. But the current location is the backyard, which doesn't have a stove mentioned. The previous steps included moving east, south, north, etc., but the stove was in the kitchen. Wait, the user was in the garden, picked up the lettuce, then went north to the backyard. Now they need to get back to the kitchen or find the stove. Maybe they need to go west through the screen door back to the kitchen, then proceed to the stove. But the current location is the backyard, so the next step should be to go west through the screen door to return to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, maybe go north to the stove area.

But the current location is the kitchen, so maybe the stove is here. The previous steps were going north from the kitchen, but the kitchen's description mentions the stove is empty. Maybe the user needs to go to the stove area. But the exits are north, south, east, west. The stove is in the kitchen, so perhaps the user is already in the right place. Wait, the user picked up the lettuce in the garden, went north to the backyard, then west back to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, they need to rest the lettuce on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, so the next action is to rest the lettuce there. The correct command would be "rest lettuce on stove" or "put lettuce on stove". The game might expect "put" or "rest".

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, the user is in the kitchen again. They have the lettuce and need to put it on the stove. The previous attempt to go north led them to the bathroom, but now they're back in the kitchen. The stove is mentioned in the kitchen description. The correct action is to go to the stove. But the exits are north, south, east, west. The stove is in the kitchen, so maybe the user needs to interact with the stove directly. The command should be "put lettuce on stove" or "rest lettuce on stove". The game might expect "put" as the verb. So the next action is to put the lettuce on the stove.

-= Bathroom =-
You are in a bathroom. A typical one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a toilet. You can see a closed usual looking bath here. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a sink. On the sink you make out a toothbrush.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the kitchen and the bathroom. They tried to put the lettuce on the stove, but it led them to the bathroom again. The problem is that the command "put lettuce on stove" might not be correct because the stove is in the kitchen, and the user is in the bathroom. The correct approach is to go back to the kitchen, then find the stove. But the user is in the bathroom, so the next step is to go south back to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, go to the stove. The previous action of going north from the kitchen led to the bathroom, so the user needs to go south again to return to the kitchen. The correct next action is "go south".

-= Kitchen =-
You've come into an ordinary room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be ordinary. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You make out a refrigerator. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove appears to be empty. You move on, clearly infuriated by TextWorld. You scan the room for a kitchen island, and you find a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, the user is in the kitchen again and tries to put the lettuce on the stove. The previous attempts led them to the bathroom, but now they're back in the kitchen. The goal is to rest the lettuce on the stove. The correct action here is to use the "put" command on the stove. Since the stove is in the kitchen, and the user has the lettuce, the next step is to put it there. The game might require the exact command "put lettuce on stove" or "rest lettuce on stove". The user has tried "put lettuce on stove" before, but it led to the bathroom. However, maybe the correct command is indeed "put lettuce on stove" and the previous issue was a mistake. So the next action is to try that command again.
