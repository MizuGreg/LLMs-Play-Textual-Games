Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, ensure that the chest drawer inside the bedroom is open. After that, take the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. After picking up the old key, unlock the wooden door. If you have unlocked the wooden door, doublecheck that the wooden door is opened. And then, head east. After that, attempt to travel south. Then, retrieve the apple from the couch within the living room. And then, take a trip north. After that, place the apple on the stove within the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a bedroom.

You can see a chest drawer. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You make out a closed antique trunk. You can make out a king-size bed. Now why would someone leave that there? The king-size bed is ordinary. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens, here in TextWorld!

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the game. They've unlocked the wooden door but can't open it because the lid is in the way. The goal is to eventually place the apple on the stove in the kitchen. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the door, but the door isn't fully open.

Wait, the error message says "You have to open the wooden door first." But they just tried to unlock it again. Maybe the door is locked but not properly opened. The user might need to open it instead of just unlocking. But the available commands include 'open' and 'unlock'. Since they already unlocked it with the key, maybe the next step is to push the door open. But the game's response says the lid is in the way, so maybe the door is closed and needs to be opened. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked and requires the key to open, but they already unlocked it. Hmm.

Wait, the user tried to 'go east' but the game says they need to open the door first. So the door is closed. They have the key, so they should unlock it. But they tried that again. The game says "That's unlocked at the moment." So maybe the door is unlocked but still closed. So the next step is to open it. But the available commands include 'open' and 'unlock'. So maybe they need to 'open wooden door' instead of unlocking again. But the user already unlocked it. Maybe the door is locked and needs to be unlocked, but the key is already used. Wait, the user has the old key in their inventory. So they should use 'unlock wooden door with old key' again. But the game says it's already unlocked. Maybe the door is unlocked but not open. So the correct action is to 'open wooden door' to get past the lid. But the game's message says the lid is in the way. So maybe the door is closed, and they need to open it. So the next action should be 'open wooden door'. But the user tried that before. Wait, the user's last action was 'unlock wooden door', and the game says it's already unlocked. So maybe the door is unlocked but still closed. So the next step is to open it. But the available commands include 'open'. So the correct command is 'open wooden door'. But the user might not have tried that yet. Let me check the previous steps.

The user tried 'unlock wooden door' again, and the game says it's already unlocked. So the door is unlocked but closed. Therefore, the next step is to open it. So the correct command is 'open wooden door'. That should allow them to go east. So the next action should be 'open wooden door'.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen now. The goal is to retrieve the apple from the living room, then place it on the stove in the kitchen. So far, they've unlocked the door, opened it, and moved east to the kitchen. The kitchen has a stove, but the apple isn't there yet. The user needs to go to the living room, get the apple, then go back to the kitchen and put it on the stove.

But the current room is the kitchen. The available directions are north, south, east, west. The screen door east is closed, the wooden door west is open. The user can go west back to the bedroom, but that's not helpful. They need to go north or south to reach the living room. The prompt says north and south are unguarded. So maybe going north or south from the kitchen would lead to the living room.

Wait, the user's next step should be to go north or south to reach the living room. But the current room is the kitchen. The user needs to go to the living room to get the apple. So the next action should be to go north or south. Let me check the room description again. The kitchen has a north and south entranceway. So the user should try going north first. Let's say they go north. Then they'll be in the living room. From there, they can retrieve the apple from the couch. Then go back to the kitchen and put it on the stove. That seems like the correct path. So the next command should be 'go north'.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Bathroom. They tried going north from the Kitchen, ended up in the Bathroom, then went south back to the Kitchen. This back-and-forth isn't helping them progress towards the goal of getting the apple from the living room and placing it on the stove.

The original plan was to go east from the Bedroom to the Kitchen, then north to the Living Room to get the apple, then back to the Kitchen to put it on the stove. But the user somehow ended up in the Bathroom instead of the Living Room. Maybe the 'go north' from the Kitchen isn't leading to the Living Room but instead to the Bathroom. That suggests that the map layout might have different connections than expected.

Wait, looking back at the Kitchen description: "You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded." So north and south from the Kitchen are unguarded. But when the user went north, they ended up in the Bathroom. That means the north exit from the Kitchen leads to the Bathroom, not the Living Room. So the Living Room must be accessible through a different direction, maybe east or west? But the Kitchen has a closed screen door east and an open wooden door west. The west door leads back to the Bedroom. So maybe the Living Room is connected to the Kitchen via another path, but the user hasn't explored that yet.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the kitchen island for the note mentioned. The kitchen island has a note. Maybe the note gives a clue about the Living Room's location. But the user hasn't examined the note yet. So the next step should be to examine the note on the kitchen island to find out where the Living Room is. Then, based on that information, navigate to the Living Room.

But the user's last action was going north again, which led to the Bathroom. So the correct approach is to check the note on the kitchen island first. The note might indicate the direction to the Living Room. So the next command should be 'examine kitchen island' to look for the note. Then, based on the note's content, proceed to the Living Room.

Okay, the user is in the Bathroom again, having tried to go north from the Kitchen, which loops back. They examined the kitchen island but couldn't find anything. The note was mentioned, but maybe they didn't check the right place. Wait, the Kitchen description says there's a note on the kitchen island. But when they examined the kitchen island, they didn't find anything. Maybe the note is hidden or requires another action. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the sink or the toothbrush. But the sink has a toothbrush, which isn't helpful. Alternatively, maybe the note is in the Bathroom, but that's not mentioned. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the Kitchen and try a different direction. The Kitchen has a screen door east and a west door. The west door leads back to the Bedroom. The user needs to get to the Living Room, which might be accessible from the Kitchen via another path. But the user is stuck in a loop. Maybe they need to check the refrigerator or counter for clues. But the refrigerator is closed. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the key again, but they already unlocked the door. Wait, the original goal was to go east from the Bedroom, unlock the door, then go east to the Kitchen, then north to the Living Room. But the user ended up in the Bathroom instead. Maybe the correct path is to go south from the Kitchen, but that leads back to the Bedroom. Hmm. Maybe the user needs to check the note again. But they couldn't find it. Alternatively, maybe the note is in the Bathroom. But the user is in the Bathroom now. Maybe they need to look around again. The Bathroom has a toilet, bath, sink, and a toothbrush. Nothing seems relevant. Maybe the user needs to try a different approach. Since the note wasn't found, perhaps the next step is to go back to the Kitchen and try another direction. But the user is in the Bathroom. So the next command should be to go south back to the Kitchen. Then, maybe check the refrigerator or counter again. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for the apple in the Living Room, but they haven't gotten there yet. So the correct next step is to go south back to the Kitchen and try another approach.

Okay, the user tried to type "go north" again, but the game said that's not a recognized verb. Wait, maybe they meant "go north" as a command. But the available commands include "go <dir>". So the correct command should be "go north". But the user might have made a typo. Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting a different command. Let me check the available commands again. The available commands include "go north", "go east", "go south", "go west". So the correct command is "go north". The user probably intended to use "go north" but the game didn't recognize it. Maybe they need to use the correct syntax. So the next action should be "go north".

I am required to announce that you are now in the bathroom. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can make out a toilet. You can make out a bath. Oh, great. Here's a sink. On the sink you see a toothbrush.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

You arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

You can see a closed refrigerator, which looks usual, in the room. You can see a counter. The counter is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out a stove. The stove is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. However, the kitchen island, like an empty kitchen island, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the kitchen island to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, the user is back in the Kitchen. They've been stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Bathroom, trying to find the Living Room. The note they took from the kitchen island might have a clue, but the game didn't display it. Maybe the note is hidden or requires another action. The Kitchen has a closed screen door east and an open door west. The user needs to get to the Living Room, which is probably accessible from the Kitchen via another path. But the previous attempts to go north or south led to the Bathroom or back to the Kitchen. Maybe the correct direction is east through the screen door. Let's try opening the screen door east and going that way. The user hasn't tried that yet. So the next action should be to open the screen door leading east.

Okay, the user is stuck again. They tried to go east but the screen door is closed. The game keeps saying they need to open it first. The user has already tried opening it but maybe the command was incorrect. The correct command should be "open screen door east". But the user might not know the exact syntax. Alternatively, maybe the door has a different name. Let me check the previous messages. The kitchen has a "closed screen door leading east". So the correct command is "open screen door east". The user tried "go east" without opening it, which is why the game says they need to open the door first. So the next action should be to open the screen door east again, making sure to use the correct command.

Okay, the user is repeatedly trying to open the screen door east but the game isn't responding correctly. The previous attempts to use "open screen door east" were misunderstood. The correct command should be "open screen door" or "open door east". Since the game's response indicates it only understood "open screen door", maybe the exact command is "open screen door". Let me check the available commands again. The available commands include "open ...", so the correct syntax is "open screen door". The user might have used "screen door east" instead of just "screen door". So the next action should be to open the screen door without specifying east, as the game might interpret it correctly.

You can see a closed refrigerator, which looks usual, in the room. You can see a counter. The counter is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out a stove. The stove is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. However, the kitchen island, like an empty kitchen island, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the kitchen island to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Bathroom =-
I am required to announce that you are now in the bathroom. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can make out a toilet. You can make out a bath. Oh, great. Here's a sink. On the sink you see a toothbrush.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Backyard =-
You arrive in a backyard. A normal one.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a set of chairs. The set of chairs is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. You see a bbq. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a bbq, go to TextWorld. The bbq is ordinary. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a patio table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?
