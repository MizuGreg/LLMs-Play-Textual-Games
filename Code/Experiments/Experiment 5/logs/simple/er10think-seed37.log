Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! First, it would be fantastic if you could ensure that the chest drawer is open. After that, recover the old key from the chest drawer. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. And then, head east. And then, make absolutely sure that the screen door within the kitchen is wide open. After that, make an effort to go to the east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to go south. With that accomplished, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After that, try to venture north. Then, make an attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove within the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
I am excited to announce that you are now in the bedroom.

You see a closed chest drawer. You can make out an antique trunk. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can make out a king-size bed! But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the king-size bed.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can make out a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out the next step here. The user has been following the instructions to open the chest drawer, get the key, unlock and open the wooden door, then go east to the kitchen. Now in the kitchen, they've interacted with the wall button revealing a stove and a note. The current score is 5/6.

The original goal was to go through various steps: open the chest drawer, get the key, unlock the door, open the door, go east, make sure the screen door is open, go east again, try south, lift milk from the garden, venture north, travel west, rest the milk on the stove. Then stop.

In the kitchen, the user needs to make sure the screen door is open. The current state says there's a closed screen door leading east. So the next action should be to open that screen door. But wait, the user's last action was going east, which led them to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the screen door is closed. The instruction said to "make absolutely sure that the screen door within the kitchen is wide open." So the next step is to open the screen door.

But looking at the available commands, the user can interact with the screen door. The previous actions in the kitchen included pressing a secret button, but maybe the screen door is a separate object. The user needs to open it. So the command should be "open screen door" or "open door east" if that's the correct phrasing. However, in the kitchen description, the screen door is listed as "closed screen door leading east." So the correct command would be "open screen door" or "open east door." But the game might require specific verbs. The user previously used "unlock" and "open," so maybe "open screen door" is the right command here.

Alternatively, maybe the screen door is already mentioned as closed, so the user needs to open it. The next step after going east is to open the screen door. Then, after that, the user is supposed to go east again. So the next action should be to open the screen door.

You can make out a set of chairs. The set of chairs is usual. However, the set of chairs, like an empty set of chairs, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a bbq. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You see a patio table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a patio table? The patio table is standard. However, the patio table, like an empty patio table, has nothing on it.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to lift the milk from the floor in the garden. They've tried "lift milk from floor" multiple times, but the game keeps saying "You can't see any such thing." Then they tried "take milk from floor" but still got the same error. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the correct verb isn't "take" or "lift". In text adventures, sometimes the right command is "get" instead of "take". Let me check the previous interactions. The user had to "take the old key from the chest drawer" earlier, so "take" worked then. But here, maybe "get" is needed. Alternatively, maybe the milk is on the floor, so the command should be "get milk" without specifying "from floor" since the game might infer the location.

Alternatively, maybe the milk is in a different location. The garden has a milk, a half of a bag of chips, a tomato plant, and a shovel on the floor. So the milk is indeed on the floor. The user tried "take milk from floor" but the game says it's not there. Maybe the correct command is just "take milk" because the game knows it's on the floor. Let me think about previous commands. When they took the key, they had to specify "from the chest drawer", but maybe here, since it's on the floor, just "take milk" would work. Alternatively, maybe "get milk".

Alternatively, maybe the game expects "pick up milk" or "pick milk". But the user has to use the exact verbs the game accepts. Since the user tried "take" and it didn't work, maybe "get" is the right verb here. Let me try to recall similar games. Often, "get" is used for picking up items. So perhaps the correct command is "get milk". But the user might have to use "take" instead. Wait, in the previous step, the user tried "take milk from floor" and it didn't work. Maybe the game doesn't require specifying "from floor" if the item is on the floor. So maybe just "take milk" without the "from floor" part. Let me check the game's previous responses. When the user took the key, they had to specify "from the chest drawer", but here, maybe the milk is on the floor, so the command is just "take milk". Alternatively, maybe the game requires "get milk".

Alternatively, maybe the milk is not visible, so the user needs to look again. But the game says "You can make out a milk..." so it's there. Maybe the correct command is "get milk". Let me try that.
