You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, assure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is wide open. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. After unlocking the wooden door, assure that the wooden door is wide open. After that, head east. Then, ensure that the screen door in the kitchen is open. Then, make an attempt to move east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to head south. Then, pick-up the lettuce from the floor of the garden. Then, travel north. Then, try to take a trip west. Then, rest the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a chest drawer. What's that over there? It looks like it's an antique trunk. Were you looking for a king-size bed? Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Oh, great. Here's a bbq. The bbq appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well Look over there! a patio table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has followed a series of steps to reach the backyard. The current score is 7/8, and they're asking if they're on the right track and what their next move should be.

First, I need to recall the original task. The goal was to: open the chest drawer in the bedroom, pick up the old key, unlock and open the wooden door, go east to the kitchen, open the screen door, go east again to the backyard, then pick up lettuce in the garden, travel north, try west, rest the lettuce on the stove, and finally stop.

So far, the user has done all the steps up to opening the screen door in the kitchen and moving east to the backyard. The next step in the original plan was to ensure the screen door in the kitchen is open (which they did), then try to move east. But after moving east, they ended up in the backyard. The next step according to the original task was to pick up the lettuce from the garden. However, the current location is the backyard, which doesn't mention a garden. Wait, maybe the garden is part of the backyard? Or perhaps there's a mistake in the steps.

Looking at the environment descriptions: in the backyard, there's a patio table, chairs, bbq, but no mention of a garden or lettuce. The user's next step was supposed to be picking up the lettuce from the garden. But in the current location (backyard), there's no lettuce. So maybe the user needs to check if the garden is elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe the lettuce is in the kitchen or another area.

Wait, the original task said: "pick-up the lettuce from the floor of the garden." So the user needs to find the garden. In the current location (backyard), there's no garden mentioned. The user might need to go north from the backyard, as the kitchen's north entrance is unblocked. Wait, in the kitchen, the user was told to try going north. But after moving east from the kitchen, they ended up in the backyard. So perhaps the garden is in the north direction from the backyard? Or maybe the user needs to check the kitchen again.

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the steps. Let me retrace:

After opening the screen door in the kitchen (step 6/7), they went east to the backyard (step 7/8). The next step in the original task was to pick up the lettuce from the garden. But in the backyard, there's no garden. So maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen and try going north, which was mentioned as unblocked. The kitchen's north entrance is unblocked, so maybe that leads to the garden. Let me check the kitchen's description again.

In the kitchen, the user was told: "You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded." So going north from the kitchen is possible. So perhaps the user should go back to the kitchen, go north, and then find the garden there. But the user is currently in the backyard. So the next step would be to go west back to the kitchen, then north to the garden.

But according to the original plan, after moving east to the backyard (step 7/8), the next step was to pick up the lettuce from the garden. Since the user is in the backyard and can't find the lettuce there, they need to find the garden. So the correct next action would be to go north from the backyard, which was mentioned as unguarded. Wait, in the backyard description, it says: "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south." So the user is in the backyard, and the south direction is unguarded. But the original plan says after the backyard, the user should go north. Wait, maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen and then north.

Alternatively, maybe the garden is in the kitchen. But the user hasn't checked that yet. The original task says to pick up the lettuce from the garden, so the user needs to find the garden. Since the current location is the backyard, and the garden isn't there, the user should go back to the kitchen and then go north. So the next step would be to go west from the backyard back to the kitchen, then north to the garden.

But the user's next action should be based on the current location. The user is in the backyard. The next step in the original plan was to pick up the lettuce from the garden. So the user needs to find the garden. Since the backyard doesn't have a garden, the user must go back to the kitchen and then go north. Therefore, the next action is to go west back to the kitchen, then north. But according to the game's current state, the user is in the backyard. The possible directions from the backyard are west (to the kitchen) and south (which is unguarded). So the user should go west to the kitchen, then north to the garden.

But the user's next action should be the immediate next step. The user is in the backyard, so the next action is to go west to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, go north to the garden. So the correct next command is "go west" to return to the kitchen.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a loop between the kitchen and the bathroom. They keep going north from the kitchen to the bathroom and then south back to the kitchen. The original goal was to pick up the lettuce from the garden, but so far, the user hasn't found it. 

Looking at the current state, the user is in the kitchen again, and the only things mentioned are the refrigerator, counter, stove, and a note on the kitchen island. There's no mention of a garden or lettuce here. The previous steps led to the backyard, but the lettuce wasn't there. Maybe the garden is in a different part of the house that's not yet explored.

Wait, the original plan said after moving east to the backyard, the next step was to pick up the lettuce from the garden. But the user ended up in the bathroom instead of the garden. Maybe there's a mistake in the path. Alternatively, perhaps the garden is in the kitchen island's note. The user saw a note on the kitchen island. Maybe the note has a clue about the garden's location.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the kitchen again for the lettuce. But the description says the stove and counter are empty. The note on the kitchen island might have a clue. The user hasn't checked the note yet. So the next step should be to look at the note on the kitchen island. But according to the game's commands, the user can only move or pick up items. Since the note is on the kitchen island, maybe the user needs to check it. However, the game might require the user to read the note, but the previous steps didn't mention that. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the backyard and check again. But the user is stuck in a loop between kitchen and bathroom. The correct path might be to go back to the kitchen, check the kitchen island for the note, and then find the garden from there. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to check the kitchen island's note. However, the game's commands might not allow that unless the user is interacting with the note. But the user's previous actions were movement-based. 

Wait, the original task said to pick up the lettuce from the garden. Maybe the garden is in the backyard, but the user didn't find it there. The user might need to look around the backyard again. But the user is currently in the kitchen. So the correct next step is to go back to the backyard, check if the lettuce is there, and then proceed. But how to get back? The user is in the kitchen, so going west to the backyard. But the user was previously in the backyard and then went to the bathroom. So maybe the user needs to go west from the kitchen to the backyard again. 

But the user is currently in the kitchen, so the next action should be to go west back to the backyard. Then check the garden there. The user might have missed the lettuce in the backyard earlier. So the correct next step is to go west from the kitchen to the backyard.

What's the point of an empty counter? You can see a stove. The stove is usual. The stove appears to be empty. You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Hmmm... what else, what else?

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the kitchen and the bathroom. They keep going north and south between these two rooms. The original goal was to pick up the lettuce from the garden, but the user hasn't found it yet. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, got the key, unlocked and opened the door, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east to the backyard. Then they tried going west back to the kitchen but got stuck in the bathroom. Now they're back in the kitchen, looping between kitchen and bathroom.

The problem might be that the user hasn't checked the kitchen island's note. The note might have a clue about the garden's location. Alternatively, maybe the garden is in a different part of the house that's not yet explored. But the user is stuck in a loop, so they need to find a way out of this cycle.

The next logical step would be to check the kitchen island's note. If the note has information about the garden, that could lead the user to the correct path. However, the game's commands might require the user to interact with the note directly. Since the user hasn't done that yet, maybe the next action should be to check the note on the kitchen island. But the user's previous actions were movement-based, so maybe they need to look around the kitchen island for the note.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the backyard and check again. But the user is in the kitchen, so they need to go west to the backyard. However, earlier attempts to go west from the kitchen led to the bathroom, which suggests that the path might be incorrect. Wait, maybe the user needs to go east from the kitchen through the screen door to the backyard again. Let me check the kitchen's description again.

In the kitchen, there's an open screen door leading east and a wooden door leading west. The user was previously in the backyard, which is east of the kitchen. So going east from the kitchen should lead back to the backyard. But earlier, when the user tried going west from the backyard, they ended up in the kitchen, then went north to the bathroom. Maybe the user needs to go east from the kitchen to the backyard again and check there for the lettuce.

So the next action should be to go east from the kitchen through the screen door to the backyard. Then check the garden there. The user might have missed the lettuce in the backyard earlier. So the correct next step is to go east from the kitchen to the backyard.

Okay, the user has been stuck in a loop between the kitchen and bathroom for a while. They picked up the lettuce in the garden and went back through the backyard. Now they're back in the kitchen, again looping between kitchen and bathroom. The original goal was to rest the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen. The user has the lettuce, so the next step should be to go to the kitchen and put it on the stove.

But the user is currently in the kitchen, so they need to go to the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, so the next action should be to go to the stove. However, the user might need to check if the stove is accessible. The kitchen description says the stove is usual and appears to be empty. So the user can try to put the lettuce on the stove. The correct command would be to "put lettuce on stove" or something similar. But according to the game's commands, the user might need to first go to the stove's location. Since the user is already in the kitchen, they can directly interact with the stove. So the next action is to put the lettuce on the stove.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in the kitchen, trying to find the stove. They have the lettuce, but can't seem to interact with the stove. The previous attempts to "go to stove" didn't work. Maybe the correct command is to "put lettuce on stove" directly. Alternatively, maybe the stove is in a different location. Wait, in the kitchen description, the stove is mentioned as "the stove is usual. The stove appears to be empty." So the user needs to put the lettuce on the stove. The correct command would be to use the "put" verb. Let me check the previous steps. The user picked up the lettuce in the garden, so now they need to go to the stove and put it there. The correct command is "put lettuce on stove".
