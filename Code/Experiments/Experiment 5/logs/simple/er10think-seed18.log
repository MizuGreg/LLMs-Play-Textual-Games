Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, open the chest drawer. Then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After pulling open the wooden door, take a trip east. And then, make sure that the screen door is wide open. After that, make an effort to move east. With that done, attempt to take a trip south. Then, pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. And then, attempt to go to the north. If you can succeed at that, make an effort to take a trip west. And then, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a chest drawer. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a closed antique trunk close by. Look over there! a king-size bed. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.

You see a refrigerator. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the refrigerator. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. You wonder idly who left that here. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

You've entered a backyard. You can barely contain your excitement.

You scan the room for a set of chairs, and you find a set of chairs! The set of chairs is typical. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? What's that over there? It looks like it's a bbq. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a bbq, go to TextWorld. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. You can see a patio table. The patio table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial task. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. They opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden. In the garden, they picked up the bell pepper. Now they're at the garden, and the next step according to the original task was to attempt to go north. The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal.

Looking at the current location, the garden has a north exit that's unblocked. The next step mentioned in the task was to go north, then west, and then rest the bell pepper on the stove. So the next action should be to go north. The user needs to move north from the garden. The previous steps have been followed correctly, so the next command should be "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user is in a loop between the kitchen and the bathroom. They've been going back and forth between the two rooms. The original goal was to rest the bell pepper on the stove. The user has the bell pepper, so the next step should be to go to the kitchen again, then find the stove, and put the bell pepper there.

But right now, they're in the bathroom. The last action was "go north" which took them back to the bathroom. The next logical step is to go south back to the kitchen. Once in the kitchen, they can go north again to the bathroom, but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe there's a way to get to the stove in the kitchen. The user needs to go to the kitchen, then find the stove. But in the kitchen description, the stove is mentioned but has nothing on it. So maybe the user needs to go to the kitchen, then go north to the bathroom again? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the user has the bell pepper, so they need to go to the stove in the kitchen. But the current location is the bathroom. So the correct next step is to go south back to the kitchen, then proceed to the stove. But the user's last action was going north to the bathroom, so the next step should be to go south back to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, they can go north again to the bathroom, but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe the user needs to go east from the kitchen through the screen door. Let me check the kitchen description again. The kitchen has an open screen door leading east and an open wooden door leading west. The user is in the bathroom, so they need to go south to the kitchen, then maybe go east to the backyard again? But the original goal was to rest the bell pepper on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen. So the user needs to be in the kitchen, then find the stove. But the user is in the bathroom. So the next step is to go south to the kitchen, then go north to the bathroom again? That's not helpful. Wait, maybe the user is stuck in a loop and needs to find another way. Alternatively, maybe the stove is in the kitchen, so once in the kitchen, the user can go to the stove. But the user is in the bathroom. So the correct next step is to go south to the kitchen, then proceed to the stove. But the user hasn't interacted with the stove yet. So the next action should be to go south from the bathroom to the kitchen, then go to the stove. But the user's last action was going north to the bathroom, so the next step is to go south back to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, the user can go north again to the bathroom, but that's not helpful. Wait, maybe the user needs to go east from the kitchen through the screen door to the backyard again, but that's not necessary. The goal is to rest the bell pepper on the stove, which is in the kitchen. So the user needs to be in the kitchen, then go to the stove. But the user is in the bathroom. So the next step is to go south to the kitchen, then go to the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next action is to go south from the bathroom to the kitchen.

Okay, the user is in the kitchen and wants to rest the bell pepper on the stove. The previous attempt to "rest the bell pepper on the stove" was rejected because "rest" isn't a recognized verb here. So I need to think of another way to put the bell pepper on the stove.

In text adventures, common verbs for placing items are "put" or "place". The user has the bell pepper, so maybe the correct command is "put the bell pepper on the stove". Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "rest the bell pepper on the stove", but since "rest" isn't valid, "put" is more likely the correct verb. So the next action should be "put the bell pepper on the stove".
