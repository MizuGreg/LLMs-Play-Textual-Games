Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, ensure that the chest drawer inside the bedroom is open. After that, take the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. After picking up the old key, unlock the wooden door. If you have unlocked the wooden door, doublecheck that the wooden door is opened. And then, head east. After that, attempt to travel south. Then, retrieve the apple from the couch within the living room. And then, take a trip north. After that, place the apple on the stove within the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a bedroom.

You can see a chest drawer. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You make out a closed antique trunk. You can make out a king-size bed. Now why would someone leave that there? The king-size bed is ordinary. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens, here in TextWorld!

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've been trying to follow a series of steps to win. The current situation is that they've unlocked the wooden door, but it's still closed. The message says, "That's unlocked at the moment," which is a bit confusing because usually, unlocking a door would open it. Maybe there's a misunderstanding in the game's feedback.

The user has already opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the door, but the door isn't opening. The next step in the original instructions was to "head east" after unlocking the door. But the game is saying they need to open the door first. Wait, maybe the door is locked from the outside, so even though they've unlocked it, they need to push it open? Or perhaps the door is jammed, and they need to find a way to open it properly.

Looking at the previous interactions, the user tried to go east but was told they need to open the door. Then they tried unlocking it again, but the game says it's already unlocked. Maybe the game's feedback is incorrect, or there's a bug. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked from the inside, so even though they have the key, they can't open it unless they're on the other side.

Wait, the original goal was to unlock the wooden door, then go east, then travel south, retrieve the apple, etc. So maybe after unlocking, they need to push the door open. The game might not be recognizing that the door is unlocked but still closed. So the next action should be to try opening the door, even though it's already unlocked. Or maybe the door is locked from the inside, so they need to find a way to open it from the outside.

Alternatively, maybe the door is just closed, and unlocking it doesn't open it. So the user needs to open it manually. The game's feedback is a bit unclear. The user's next step should be to try opening the door, even though it's already unlocked. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user tried to go east, but the game said they need to open the door. Then they tried unlocking again, but the game said it's already unlocked. So maybe the door is locked from the inside, and the key only unlocks it, but they need to push it open. So the next action should be to open the door, even though it's already unlocked. The game might be expecting the user to try opening it despite the message.

So the correct next action would be to try opening the door. The user should try to open it, even though the game says it's unlocked. Maybe the game's feedback is misleading, and the actual action is needed. Therefore, the next command should be "open wooden door" or "push wooden door".

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text adventure game and needs to follow a series of steps to win. The current score is 5 out of 25, and they've been moving between rooms, unlocking doors, and checking items.

First, the original goal was to open the chest drawer, take the key, unlock the door, check it's open, go east, then travel south to the living room to get the apple, then go north to the kitchen, place the apple on the stove, and win. 

But from the logs, the user has been looping between the bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom, not making progress towards the living room or the apple. The key was picked up and the door unlocked, but after opening the door east, they went into the kitchen, then bathroom, then back to kitchen, etc. The apple in the living room hasn't been retrieved yet.

The user's current position is in the kitchen again. The next step should be to go north from the kitchen to the living room. Wait, in the kitchen description, it says "You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded." So going north from the kitchen should lead to the living room. Once there, they need to retrieve the apple from the couch and then go north to the kitchen to place it on the stove.

But in the previous steps, the user hasn't gone north from the kitchen yet. So the next action should be to go north from the kitchen to the living room. Then, once there, take the apple, go north to the kitchen, and place it on the stove. That would complete the goal.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom. They've been going back and forth between these rooms, but they haven't found the apple or completed the objectives. The original goal was to retrieve the apple from the living room and place it on the stove in the kitchen. But so far, the user hasn't even reached the living room.

Looking at the current location, the user is in the bedroom again. The chest drawer was opened earlier, and the old key was taken. The wooden door was unlocked, but the user hasn't gone through it yet. Wait, the initial instructions said after unlocking the door, they should go east, then attempt to travel south. But the user kept going back and forth between the kitchen and bathroom, missing the living room.

Maybe the user didn't realize that after going east from the bedroom, they need to go south to reach the living room. The problem is that the user is stuck in a cycle, not progressing towards the living room. The key steps missed are: after unlocking the door, go east to the kitchen, then south to the living room to get the apple, then north to the kitchen again to place it on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet.

So the next action should be to go south from the kitchen to reach the living room where the apple is. But the user is currently in the bedroom, so they need to go east first, then south. However, the user's last action was going west back to the bedroom. Therefore, the correct next step is to go east from the bedroom to the kitchen, then south to the living room. But since the user is in the bedroom, the immediate next action is to go east again to proceed towards the living room.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps given in the initial instruction. The goal was to eventually place the apple on the stove in the kitchen. So far, they've managed to get the old key, unlock the door, and navigate through the bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, and back. But they're stuck in the kitchen, trying to find the apple.

The note on the kitchen island says the dinner is missing a grilled apple. The user tried taking the apple from the kitchen island but couldn't. Then they looked again and saw the note, but the apple isn't there. Wait, maybe the apple is somewhere else? The original plan was to retrieve the apple from the couch in the living room. But the user hasn't gone to the living room yet. They've been moving between the kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, etc., but not the living room.

Ah, right. The steps mentioned going east from the bedroom, then traveling south, then retrieving the apple from the couch in the living room. But the user has been going back and forth between kitchen and bedroom. So maybe they need to go back to the living room. Let me check the previous steps.

Wait, after unlocking the door and going east, they were in the kitchen. Then they went north to the bathroom, then south back to kitchen, west to bedroom, east again to kitchen. They haven't gone south from the kitchen to the living room. The kitchen has an unguarded south entrance. So the next step should be to go south from the kitchen to the living room, get the apple from the couch, then go north to the kitchen again, place the apple on the stove. But the user is currently in the kitchen, so the next action should be to go south to the living room. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next step is to go south from the kitchen to the living room.

You are in a living room. An ordinary kind of place.

You can make out a couch. The couch is typical. On the couch you see an apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a low table. The low table is normal. On the low table you make out a remote, so there's that. You can see a tv. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a tv, go to TextWorld. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game, and they've been moving around different rooms like the bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, and living room. Their goal is to follow a series of steps: open the chest drawer, take the old key, unlock the door, go east, travel south, get the apple from the couch, then go north and put the apple on the stove. 

So far, they've managed to open the chest drawer, take the key, unlock the door, and go east to the kitchen. Then they went back through various rooms, finally reaching the living room where they took the apple from the couch. Now they're back in the kitchen, and the next step according to the original instructions was to take the apple to the kitchen and place it on the stove. 

But in the current state, the user is in the kitchen again, and the stove is mentioned as being empty. The apple was taken from the couch in the living room. The next logical step would be to go back to the living room, but wait, the user just came from the living room. Wait, no, after taking the apple from the couch in the living room, they went north to the kitchen. Now they're back in the kitchen. So they need to go back to the living room again to get the apple, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the apple was taken from the couch, so they have it. Then they need to go to the kitchen and put it on the stove. 

But in the current scenario, the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is empty. The apple is in their inventory, I assume. So the next step is to go to the stove, put the apple there. But the user is in the kitchen, so they need to go to the stove. However, in the kitchen description, the stove is standard but empty. The user has the apple, so they should be able to put it on the stove. 

But looking at the previous steps, after taking the apple from the couch, they went north to the kitchen. Now they're in the kitchen again. The next action should be to go to the stove, but the stove is mentioned as being in the kitchen. So the user needs to go to the stove, then put the apple there. However, the user's last action was going south from the bathroom back to the kitchen. So the current location is the kitchen. The next step is to go to the stove, then put the apple on it. 

But the user's last command was "go south" which brought them back to the kitchen. So the next step is to go to the stove. However, in the kitchen description, the stove is mentioned as being there. So the user should go to the stove, then put the apple on it. But the user hasn't interacted with the stove yet. 

Wait, the original instructions said after taking the apple from the couch, go north to the kitchen and place it on the stove. So the user is in the kitchen, and the apple is in their inventory. So the next step is to put the apple on the stove. But the stove is in the kitchen. So the user needs to go to the stove, then put the apple there. 

But in the current state, the user is in the kitchen. So the next action should be to go to the stove. However, the user might need to check if the stove is accessible. The kitchen description says the stove is standard but empty. So the user can put the apple on it. 

Therefore, the correct next action is to go to the stove, then put the apple there. But the user is already in the kitchen. So the next step is to go to the stove. However, the user might need to use the command "go to stove" or "go to stove". But in the game's context, the user might need to use the command "put apple on stove" once they are at the stove. 

But the user is in the kitchen, so the next step is to go to the stove. However, the stove is already in the kitchen. So the user can just go to the stove. But the game might require the user to use the command "go to stove" or "go to the stove". Alternatively, since the stove is in the kitchen, the user might just need to interact with it. 

But looking at the previous steps, when the user was in the kitchen, they could interact with the stove. So the next action is to go to the stove, then put the apple on it. However, the user might need to first go to the stove. 

But in the current state, the user is in the kitchen. The stove is in the kitchen. So the user can directly interact with the stove. Therefore, the next action is to put the apple on the stove. But the user needs to be at the stove. So the correct command would be "go to stove" or "go to the stove". But in the game's context, the user might need to use the command "go to stove" or "go to the stove". 

Alternatively, since the user is already in the kitchen, they can directly put the apple on the stove. But the game might require the user to be at the stove's location. Therefore, the next step is to go to the stove, then put the apple there. 

But the user is in the kitchen, so the next action is to go to the stove. However, the game might not have a "go to stove" command. Instead, the user might need to use "go north" or another direction. But in the kitchen, the stove is part of the room. So the user can interact with it directly. 

Therefore, the correct next action is to put the apple on the stove. But the user needs to be at the stove. Since the user is in the kitchen, they can directly interact with the stove. So the next action is "put apple on stove".
