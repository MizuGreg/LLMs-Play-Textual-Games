I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First stop, open the chest drawer. After that, recover the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. And then, open the wooden door inside the bedroom. Then, go to the east. And then, look and see that the screen door in the kitchen is ajar. After that, make an effort to venture east. And then, attempt to move south. With that accomplished, lift the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. After that, move north. Okay, and then, attempt to take a trip west. Following that, rest the bell pepper on the stove. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
You've fallen into an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the bedroom.

You can see a closed chest drawer. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an antique trunk. Hmm. You always thought you'd be more excited to see an antique trunk in a room. You can make out a king-size bed. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and tried to go east but were told they need to open the door first. The door is already unlocked, but maybe they need to open it fully?

Wait, the previous action was trying to go east, and the game said the door has to be opened first. But the user just unlocked it, so maybe the door is locked but not yet open. The message said "That's unlocked at the moment," which might mean the key is in the lock, but the door isn't fully open. So maybe the next step is to open the door instead of just unlocking it?

The user's next action should be to open the wooden door. Let me check the previous steps again. They had the old key, unlocked the door, but maybe the door is still closed. So the correct action is to open the door. The game might require using the key to open it, but since it's already unlocked, perhaps just opening it is the next step. So the next command should be "open the wooden door".

You make out a closed refrigerator nearby. You can see a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is normal. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Garden scene. The description says there's a lettuce, a bell pepper, an apple, and a shovel on the floor. The user tried to take the bell pepper but got "You can't see any such thing." Wait, that's confusing because the description clearly mentions the bell pepper is there. Maybe the issue is that the bell pepper is not visible, or perhaps the correct command is different.

Wait, the user tried "take the bell pepper from the floor" three times, but each time it says "You can't see any such thing." But according to the scene description, the bell pepper is on the floor. Maybe the game expects a different verb, like "pick up" instead of "take"? Or maybe the object is named differently. Let me check the exact wording again.

The scene says: "There is a lettuce, a bell pepper, an apple and a shovel on the floor." So the bell pepper is present. The user's command is "take the bell pepper from the floor". The game responds that it can't see the bell pepper. That's contradictory. Maybe the game expects the command to be "take the bell pepper" without specifying the floor, since the bell pepper is already on the floor. Or perhaps the user needs to first pick up the bell pepper, but the game is not recognizing it. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "pick up the bell pepper".

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to use the verb "get" instead of "take". But in TextWorld, the correct verb is usually "take". However, sometimes games use different verbs. Let me think. The user has already tried "take" three times. Maybe the game is case-sensitive? Like "Bell Pepper" with a capital B? But the description uses lowercase. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "pick up" instead of "take".

Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting the user to use the correct object name. Let me check the scene again. The objects are "lettuce", "bell pepper", "apple", and "shovel". So the correct name is "bell pepper". So the command should be "take the bell pepper". But the user is getting an error. Maybe the game is expecting the user to use "get" instead of "take". Let me try that. If the user says "get the bell pepper", would that work? But the user has to follow the correct command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "take the bell pepper from the floor" but the game is not recognizing it because the bell pepper is already on the floor. Wait, but the user is in the garden, and the bell pepper is on the floor. So maybe the correct command is just "take the bell pepper".

But the game is saying "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the user is supposed to look around first? But the user is already in the garden. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the correct verb. Let me think. In TextWorld, the correct command is usually "take" for picking up items. So maybe the user should try "take the bell pepper" again. But the user tried that three times. Maybe the game is broken, but the user has to keep trying. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "pick up" instead. But the user is supposed to follow the correct commands. So the next action should be "take the bell pepper" again, even though it's not working. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "get the bell pepper".

But the user's last action was "take the bell pepper from the floor" and the game said "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the correct command is just "take the bell pepper" without specifying the floor. Let me try that. The user's next action should be "take the bell pepper".

Okay, the user is stuck in the Garden scene. They have the bell pepper picked up and need to move north. The game keeps saying "You must name something more substantial" when they try to move north. Wait, maybe the correct command is "go north" instead of "move north"? In TextWorld, the standard command is "go" followed by direction. So instead of "move north", they should use "go north". Let me check previous interactions. The user tried "move north" multiple times, but the game didn't accept it. The correct verb here is "go". So the next action should be "go north".

Okay, the user is in the Garden scene again. They have the bell pepper picked up earlier, but now they're trying to take it from the floor again, and the game says they can't see it. Wait, maybe the bell pepper is already in their inventory, so they don't need to take it again. The previous action was taking the bell pepper, and the game confirmed they picked it up. Now, the user is trying to take it again, but it's not there. The scene description says there's a lettuce, apple, and shovel on the floor, but the bell pepper might be in the user's inventory. So the correct action now is to move north again, since the goal is to rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is stuck trying to take the bell pepper. Maybe they need to just move on without taking it again. The next step after taking the bell pepper is to move north to the kitchen or another area. But the user is getting stuck in a loop. The correct command should be "go north" to proceed to the next part of the game.

-= Backyard =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so typical all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the backyard. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You make out a set of chairs. The set of chairs is usual. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make out a bbq. The bbq is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You see a patio table. The patio table is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, the user is trying to "rest the bell pepper on the stove" but the game says that's not a recognized verb. Let me think about the correct command. In TextWorld, the verb for putting an item down is usually "put". So instead of "rest", they should use "put". The correct command would be "put the bell pepper on the stove". Let me check if that's the right action. The user has the bell pepper in their inventory, so putting it on the stove should be the next step. The previous steps were moving around the garden and backyard, and now they need to interact with the stove. So the next action is to put the bell pepper on the stove.

Okay, the user is trying to put the bell pepper on the stove but the game says they can't see it. Let me check the current scene. The user is in the Garden, and the description mentions a lettuce, apple, and shovel on the floor. The stove isn't mentioned here. Wait, maybe the stove is in the kitchen. The user previously went through the kitchen and backyard. Maybe the stove is in the kitchen, and the user needs to go back to the kitchen to put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is currently in the garden. So the correct action is to go north back to the kitchen where the stove is. The previous attempt to move north was successful, leading back to the backyard. Then, maybe going south from the backyard to the garden again. Wait, the user is in the garden, and the stove is in the kitchen. So the user needs to go back to the kitchen. The correct command would be "go north" to reach the kitchen again. But the user is stuck in the garden. Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the garden, tried to put the bell pepper on the stove, but couldn't because the stove isn't here. So the next step is to go back to the kitchen where the stove is located. The correct command is "go north" to move back to the kitchen.

Okay, the user is in the Garden again, trying to put the bell pepper on the stove. But the stove isn't here. The previous attempts to move north led to the Backyard, and going south brings them back to the Garden. The key is that the stove is in the kitchen. The user needs to go back to the kitchen through the Backyard. The correct command is "go north" from the Backyard to reach the kitchen where the stove is located. So the next action should be "go north" to proceed to the kitchen and then put the bell pepper on the stove there.

Okay, the user is in the Backyard again, trying to get to the kitchen to put the bell pepper on the stove. The previous attempts to go north led to the Garden, and going south brings them back to the Backyard. The correct path is to go west through the open screen door to reach the Kitchen. The user needs to move west to access the kitchen where the stove is. So the next action should be "go west" to proceed to the kitchen.

You are in a kitchen. A standard kind of place. Let's see what's in here.

You make out a closed refrigerator nearby. You can see a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is normal. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.
