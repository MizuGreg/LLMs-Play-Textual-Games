I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, ensure that the antique trunk in the bedroom is open. Then, take the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. After taking the old key, unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. And then, assure that the wooden door is wide open. After that, move east. Okay, and then, doublecheck that the screen door in the kitchen is opened. After that, travel east. That done, make an attempt to move south. After that, recover the tomato plant from the floor of the garden. Then, make an attempt to take a trip north. With that over with, go to the west. After that, sit the tomato plant on the stove inside the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just walked into a bedroom.

You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a chest drawer. What's that over there? It looks like it's an antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, and tried to unlock the wooden door. But the system didn't understand "unlock the wooden door in the bedroom" the first time, maybe because of wording. Then the user tried again with the same command, and it's still not working. Wait, no, the user just said "unlock the wooden door in the bedroom" again, and the system didn't understand. Then the user is asking if they're on the right track and what the next action should be.

First, I need to figure out the correct command for unlocking the door. The game might expect a specific verb. Maybe "unlock" is correct, but perhaps the door is already closed, and the key is needed. Wait, the user has the key now. So the next step is to use the key to unlock the door. But the previous attempt was to "unlock the wooden door in the bedroom", which the system didn't understand. Maybe the correct command is "use old key on wooden door" or something similar. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is in the trunk, so after taking the key, the user needs to unlock the door with it.

But the user's last action was taking the key. Now, the next step is to unlock the door. The system might require the command "unlock the wooden door" without specifying the bedroom, but the user is in the bedroom. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed. So the correct command would be "unlock the wooden door" or "use key on door". But the user tried "unlock the wooden door in the bedroom" and it didn't work. Maybe the system expects "unlock the door" or "unlock the wooden door" without the location. Alternatively, maybe the door is already unlocked, but the user needs to open it further.

Wait, the original task said: "After taking the old key, unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. And then, assure that the wooden door is wide open." So the user needs to unlock the door, then open it wide. So the correct command is "unlock the wooden door in the bedroom". But the system didn't understand it. Maybe the system is case-sensitive or uses different wording. Maybe "unlock the door" is sufficient. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the key to unlock it. So perhaps the correct command is "use old key on wooden door".

But the user's previous attempt was "unlock the wooden door in the bedroom", which the system didn't understand. Then the user is asking if they're on the right track. The user's score is 2/3, so they need to complete the steps. The next action should be to unlock the door. Since the system didn't understand the previous command, maybe the correct command is "unlock the door" or "use key to unlock door". But the user has the key, so maybe "use old key on wooden door" is the right command. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is needed. So the correct action is to unlock the door with the key. Therefore, the next command should be "unlock the wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is in a TextWorld game and has to follow a series of steps. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and the score is now 3/4. The next step according to the original task was to "assure that the wooden door is wide open." So after unlocking it, they need to make sure it's fully open. The command here would be to open the door. But in the game, maybe the correct verb is "open" instead of "unlock" again. The user previously tried "unlock the wooden door in the bedroom" which didn't work, but after using the key, they successfully unlocked it. Now, they need to open it wide. So the next action should be "open the wooden door" or "open the door wide." Since the game might expect a specific command, "open the wooden door" is likely the right choice. Then, after that, they have to move east. So the next step after opening the door is to go east. But first, make sure the door is open. So the current step is to open the door.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen room now. The original task was to double-check that the screen door in the kitchen is opened. So far, the user has been in the Bedroom, unlocked the door, opened it, moved east to the Kitchen, and now they need to check the screen door.

Looking at the current room description, the screen door is listed as "closed screen door leading east". The task says to "doublecheck that the screen door in the kitchen is opened". So the next step is to open that screen door.

The available commands include "open ...", so the correct command here would be "open screen door". But the user needs to make sure they are opening the correct door. The door is in the Kitchen, and the command should be "open screen door" or "open the screen door". Since the game might require the exact phrasing, "open screen door" is likely the right command. After opening it, the user can proceed to the next step, which was to travel east again. But first, they need to open the screen door.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Backyard now. The original task was to "recover the tomato plant from the floor of the garden. Then, make an attempt to take a trip north. With that over with, go to the west. After that, sit the tomato plant on the stove inside the kitchen."

So far, the user has been in the Bedroom, unlocked the door, opened it, moved east to the Kitchen, opened the screen door, moved east again to the Backyard. Now, the next step is to find the tomato plant in the garden. But the current room is the Backyard, which according to the description has a patio table, chairs, a BBQ, but no mention of a tomato plant. The garden might be a different room, perhaps south of the Backyard since there's an exit to the south.

The user needs to go south to the garden. The current room has an exit to the south, so the next command should be "go south". Then, in the garden, they can look for the tomato plant. Once found, they need to take it and then go north. But the user's current location is the Backyard, so the next step is to move south to the garden. The correct command here is "go south".

You've entered a garden. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is a bell pepper, a tomato plant, a milk and a shovel on the floor.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, the user is in the Garden room. The task is to "recover the tomato plant from the floor of the garden." The user has already taken the tomato plant from the floor, but the system says "You can't see any such thing." Wait, maybe the command was "take tomato plant from floor" but the game doesn't recognize it. The available commands include "take ... from ...", so maybe the correct command is "take tomato plant from floor". But the user tried that and got an error. Alternatively, maybe the tomato plant is just on the floor, so the command is "take tomato plant". Let me check the available commands again. The user can "take ... from ...", so perhaps the correct command is "take tomato plant from floor". But the system said "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the tomato plant is not visible, so the user needs to "examine" it first. But the user hasn't examined anything yet. Alternatively, maybe the command is simply "take tomato plant". Let me think. The user is in the Garden, and the description says there's a tomato plant on the floor. So the correct command should be "take tomato plant from floor" or "take tomato plant". Since the user tried "take tomato plant from floor" and got an error, maybe the correct command is just "take tomato plant". Let me try that.

You can see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing is empty. You see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, the user is trying to "sit the tomato plant on the stove inside the kitchen." But the game doesn't understand the command. Let me check the available commands again. The user has the tomato plant in their inventory. The correct command should be "put tomato plant on stove" since "sit" isn't a valid verb here. The available commands include "put ... on ...", so the right action is to use that. Therefore, the next command should be "put tomato plant on stove".
