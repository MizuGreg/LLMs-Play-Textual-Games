I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, ensure that the antique trunk in the bedroom is open. Then, take the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. After taking the old key, unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. And then, assure that the wooden door is wide open. After that, move east. Okay, and then, doublecheck that the screen door in the kitchen is opened. After that, travel east. That done, make an attempt to move south. After that, recover the tomato plant from the floor of the garden. Then, make an attempt to take a trip north. With that over with, go to the west. After that, sit the tomato plant on the stove inside the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just walked into a bedroom.

You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a chest drawer. What's that over there? It looks like it's an antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

<think>
Okay, the user is having trouble with the game. They've been trying to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom, but every time they try, the system says they didn't understand the sentence. Let me check the previous interactions.

The user first tried "unlock wooden door in bedroom" and got an error. Then they tried "unlock the wooden door in the bedroom" and still got the same response. The system is probably expecting a different phrasing. Maybe the correct command is "unlock the door" or "open the door" since the door is described as "closed wooden door leading east."

Wait, the original instruction was to "unlock the wooden door in the bedroom." The game might be using a specific verb or structure. Let me think about possible variations. Maybe "unlock the door" without specifying "wooden" or "bedroom." Alternatively, the game might require using "open" instead of "unlock" if the door is locked. But the user already has the key, so unlocking makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "use old key on wooden door" since they have the key. But the user hasn't tried that yet. However, the previous steps were to take the key from the trunk, so they should have it. Let me check the history again.

The user took the old key from the trunk. Now they need to unlock the door. The system might be expecting "unlock the door" or "unlock the wooden door." But the user keeps getting errors. Maybe the correct command is "unlock the door" without the "wooden" part. Let me try that. Alternatively, maybe the door is already in the room, so just "unlock door."

But the user's last attempt was "unlock the wooden door in the bedroom," which the system didn't understand. Maybe the correct command is "unlock the door" or "open the door." Since the door is closed, maybe "open" is the right verb. But the user was told to unlock it. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the game expects "unlock the door" without specifying the location. Let me try that. If that doesn't work, maybe the user needs to use the key. So the next action should be "unlock the door" or "open the door." Let's go with "unlock the door" as the next command.

Okay, let's see. The user is having trouble getting the game to recognize their commands. They've tried several variations of "unlock the wooden door" and "open wooden door," but the game keeps misunderstanding. The score has increased a bit, but they're stuck on the bedroom door.

First, I need to figure out why the game isn't recognizing the correct commands. Maybe the game's parser is sensitive to exact phrasing. The user's previous attempts used "unlock" and "open," but the game might expect a specific verb. Let me check the original task again. The user was told to "unlock the wooden door in the bedroom" and "assure that the wooden door is wide open." 

Wait, maybe the game requires using "open" instead of "unlock" for the door. Sometimes, doors are opened with "open," while locks are unlocked. But the user already has the key, so maybe "unlock" is correct. However, the game might have specific verbs. Alternatively, maybe the door is already locked, and the user needs to use "open" to push it open after unlocking.

But the user tried "unlock the wooden door" and the game didn't understand. Maybe the correct command is "open the wooden door" instead. Let me think about the game's possible command structure. In many text adventures, "open" is the verb for doors, and "unlock" is for locks. But since the user has the key, maybe "unlock" is correct. However, the game might require "open" to actually move the door.

Alternatively, maybe the game expects "open the wooden door" without the "unlock" part. The user's previous attempts used "unlock the wooden door," but the game didn't recognize it. So perhaps the correct command is "open the wooden door." Let me try that. If the door is locked, unlocking it with the key would allow opening it. But the game might need "open" as the verb. 

Alternatively, maybe the game requires "push the wooden door" or "pull the wooden door." But the user's task was to "assure that the wooden door is wide open," so "open" is the right action. 

Given that the user has already tried "unlock the wooden door" multiple times and the game didn't understand, maybe the correct command is "open the wooden door." Let me try that. If the door is locked, unlocking it first with the key would allow opening. But the game might require "open" without the "unlock." 

So the next step is to try "open the wooden door" to see if that works. If not, maybe the game expects "open door" or "open the door." But the user's task specifies the wooden door in the bedroom, so "open the wooden door in the bedroom" might be the exact command. However, the user's previous attempts didn't include "in the bedroom," but the game might not require it. 

Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting "open door" without specifying the wooden door. But the user's task is to open the wooden door in the bedroom. So the correct command is likely "open the wooden door." Let's try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is having trouble with the game. They've been trying to unlock and open the wooden door in the bedroom. The system keeps responding with "open wooden door in bedroom" but the user keeps getting the same message that it only understood up to opening the door.

Hmm, maybe the issue is that the command is too repetitive. The user might need to use a different verb or structure. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "unlock wooden door in bedroom" multiple times, but the system didn't recognize it. Then they switched to "open wooden door in bedroom," which the system also didn't understand properly.

Wait, maybe the correct command is just "open door" or "unlock door" without specifying "wooden" or "bedroom"? But the game's context is specific, so the system might require the exact phrasing. Alternatively, perhaps the door is already locked, and the user needs to use the key to unlock it first. But the user already took the key from the trunk and tried to unlock the door. The system might be expecting a different action after unlocking.

Looking back at the original task: after unlocking the door, the user needs to ensure it's wide open, then move east. Maybe after unlocking, the next step is to open it fully. But the system is not recognizing "open wooden door in bedroom" correctly. Maybe the correct command is "open door" or "open the door" without the "wooden" part. Or perhaps the system is expecting "push the door" or "pull the door" once it's unlocked.

Alternatively, maybe the user should just try "open door" since the context is the bedroom's wooden door. The system might be having trouble parsing the specific details. Let me try to think of the most straightforward command that would work. Since the user has the key, maybe "open door" is sufficient. Or maybe "unlock door" again. But the user already tried that. Wait, the system's previous response was that the user tried to open the door but it wasn't understood. Maybe the correct command is "open the door" with the article. Let me check the previous messages. The user tried "open wooden door in bedroom" but the system didn't understand. Maybe the correct command is just "open door" without the extra details. Alternatively, the system might need the exact phrase "open wooden door" in the bedroom. But the user is getting stuck here.

Given that the user is repeatedly trying to open the door and the system isn't recognizing it, perhaps the next step is to try a simpler command like "open door" or "unlock door" without the extra descriptors. However, the game's environment might require the specific terms. Alternatively, maybe the door is already unlocked, and the user needs to push it open. But the user's task is to ensure it's wide open after unlocking. So maybe the correct action is "open door" or "push door". Let me try that.

You can see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing is empty. You see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a set of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've managed to open the antique trunk, take the old key, unlock and open the wooden door in the bedroom, then move east to the kitchen, open the screen door, go east to the backyard, and then south to the garden. In the garden, they need to recover the tomato plant from the floor.

But the user is having trouble. They tried "take tomato plant from floor" multiple times, but the game keeps saying "You can't see any such thing." Hmm. Wait, maybe the tomato plant isn't on the floor? Let me check the description again. The garden has a bell pepper, a tomato plant, a milk and a shovel on the floor. Oh, the tomato plant is indeed on the floor. So why can't the user take it?

Wait, maybe the command should be "take tomato plant" without specifying "from floor" since the plant is already on the floor. Or maybe the game expects a different phrasing. The user might need to just say "take tomato plant" instead of "take tomato plant from floor." Let me think. In many text adventures, you don't need to specify "from floor" if the object is already on the floor. So the correct command would be "take tomato plant." Let me try that.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete a task. The goal seems to involve interacting with objects in different rooms, like opening a trunk, finding a key, unlocking a door, and eventually moving through various rooms to reach a certain objective.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Kitchen again after repeatedly moving between the Kitchen, Bathroom, and other rooms. The score is at 9/27, which suggests they've been moving around a lot but haven't completed all the required tasks. The original goal mentioned in the beginning was to take the tomato plant from the garden, put it on the stove in the kitchen, and then stop. 

Wait, the user did take the tomato plant from the garden earlier (they had to pick it up, even though they initially couldn't see it). Then they were supposed to take it to the kitchen and put it on the stove. But in the current state, they're stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Bathroom, moving north and south without making progress towards the final task. 

The user might have forgotten to place the tomato plant on the stove. Let me check the previous steps. After taking the tomato plant from the garden, they went north to the Backyard, then west to the Kitchen, then north to the Bathroom, and back to the Kitchen. But they haven't mentioned putting the plant on the stove yet. 

So the next logical step would be to go back to the Kitchen where the stove is located and place the tomato plant on it. The user has the tomato plant in their inventory since they picked it up. Therefore, the correct action now is to go to the Kitchen (they are already there) and use the "put tomato plant on stove" command. But since the user is currently in the Kitchen, they need to execute that action. However, the game's current state shows the Kitchen again, so the next step is to put the plant on the stove. 

But the user's last action was "go south" leading back to the Kitchen. So the next command should be to put the tomato plant on the stove. However, the user might not have the plant in their inventory, but earlier they did pick it up. So the correct command is to put it on the stove. But the system message says to only output the action, so the answer should be "put tomato plant on stove".
