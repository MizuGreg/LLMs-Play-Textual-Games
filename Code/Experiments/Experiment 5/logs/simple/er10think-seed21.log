You are now playing a profound game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to open the antique trunk in the bedroom. After that, pick up the old key from the antique trunk. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. And then, open the wooden door inside the bedroom. And then, attempt to go east. Following that, go to the south. Then, recover the apple from the couch in the living room. After that, try to venture north. After that, put the apple on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in a bedroom.

You see a closed chest drawer. You see a closed antique trunk in the room. You can see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can make out a refrigerator. You see a counter. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove! The stove is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a kitchen island. You shudder, but continue examining the kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can make out a note. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

-= Living Room =-
You are in a living room. An ordinary kind of place.

You can see a couch. The couch is standard. On the couch you can see an apple. You smell a great smell, and follow it to a low table. On the low table you see a remote. You can make out a tv. The tv is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is playing a text-based game and has reached the Living Room. Their goal is to recover the apple from the couch, then put it on the stove. Let me check the current state.

In the Living Room, the user sees a couch with an apple on it. The previous attempt to "recover apple" was incorrect because "recover" isn't a valid verb here. The correct action would be to pick up the apple. The user might have confused "recover" with "pick up" or "take". 

So the next step is to use the correct verb. Since the apple is on the couch, the command should be "take apple" or "pick up apple". The game's response after "recover apple" indicated that it's not a recognized verb, so the user needs to try again with the right command.

The user also asked if they're on the right track. They have completed the earlier steps: opening the trunk, getting the key, unlocking and opening the door, going east to the kitchen, then south to the living room. Now, the next steps are to pick up the apple, then go north to the kitchen (since the exit is unblocked north from the living room), and put the apple on the stove. 

Therefore, the correct next action is to pick up the apple from the couch. The user needs to input "take apple" or "pick up apple". Since the game's previous response didn't accept "recover", the correct command is "take apple".
</think>take apple
