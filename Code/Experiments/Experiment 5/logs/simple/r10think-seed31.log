You are now playing a life changing game of TextWorld! First stop, open the antique trunk. After pulling open the antique trunk, take the old key from the antique trunk within the bedroom. If you can get your hands on the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. And then, look and see that the wooden door is ajar. After that, try to go east. Then, try to move south. After that, retrieve the lettuce from the couch. And then, try to head north. Then, place the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. An ordinary one.

You can see a closed chest drawer in the corner. You see an antique trunk. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a king-size bed. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the game because they keep trying to go east but the door isn't opening. They have the old key, but maybe they're not using it correctly. Wait, the previous attempts to unlock the door with the key were failing. The game message says "That's unlocked at the moment." Hmm, maybe the key isn't working here. But earlier, when they unlocked the door, it worked. Wait, maybe the door is locked again after being unlocked? Or perhaps the key is for a different lock.

Wait, the original instruction said to unlock the wooden door with the old key. Then, after that, go east. But the user tried to go east before the door was properly unlocked. But the game says the door is already unlocked. Wait, maybe the user is trying to go east into a room where the door is open, but the game is not allowing movement until the door is opened. Or maybe the door is locked again after being unlocked. Alternatively, maybe the key is for a different door.

Wait, the initial steps were: open the trunk, take the key, unlock the door. Then go east. But when the user tried to go east, the game said they need to open the door first. But the user already unlocked it. Maybe the door is not actually open. Wait, the user's previous action was unlocking the door, but the game message says "That's unlocked at the moment." Maybe the door is locked again. Or maybe the key is not the right one. Wait, the key was taken from the trunk, which was in the bedroom. So the key is for the wooden door. But maybe the door is locked again after being unlocked. Or perhaps the user needs to open the door instead of unlocking it. Wait, the user tried to unlock it, but maybe the correct action is to open it. Let me check the original instructions again.

Original instructions: "assure that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. And then, look and see that the wooden door is ajar. After that, try to go east." So maybe after unlocking, the door is ajar, so the user can go east. But in the game, when the user tried to go east, the game said they need to open the door first. But the user already unlocked it. Maybe the game is confused. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to open the door instead of unlocking it. But the key was used to unlock it. Maybe the correct action is to open the door. But the user tried to go east, and the game says the door is locked. But the user already unlocked it. This is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to open the door with the key, but the game is not recognizing that. The user tried to unlock it, but the game says it's already unlocked. Maybe the key is not working. But the key was taken from the trunk. Maybe the user needs to open the door, not unlock it. So perhaps the correct action is to open the door. But the user tried to go east and the game says the door is locked. Wait, the user's last action was trying to go east again, but the game says they need to open the door. But the user already unlocked it. Maybe the game is not updating the state correctly. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked again after being unlocked. So the user needs to unlock it again. But the key is already in their inventory. So the user should try to unlock the door again. But the game says "That's unlocked at the moment." Maybe the user needs to open the door instead of unlocking it. So the next action should be to open the door. But the user tried to go east and the game says the door is locked. This is a bit of a loop. The user needs to figure out the correct action to proceed. Since the user has the key, maybe the correct action is to open the door. So the next command should be "open the wooden door" instead of unlocking it. But the user previously used "unlock the wooden door with the old key". Maybe the game expects "open" instead of "unlock". So the next action should be "open the wooden door".

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An usual kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You see a refrigerator. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is standard. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a stove. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Wow! Just like in the movies!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.
