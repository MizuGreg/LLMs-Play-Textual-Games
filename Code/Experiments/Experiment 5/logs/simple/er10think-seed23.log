You are now playing a profound session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, ensure that the antique trunk is open. And then, recover the old key from the antique trunk in the bedroom. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. Then, open the wooden door. And then, move east. And then, make absolutely sure that the screen door is open. Having opened the screen door, attempt to head east. With that done, move south. Then, retrieve the apple from the floor of the garden. And then, make an attempt to venture north. If you can succeed at that, head west. With that accomplished, sit the apple on the stove inside the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in a bedroom.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a chest drawer, so there's that. You make out a closed antique trunk in the corner. You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

<think>
Okay, let me think through this. The user is playing a text-based game and has reached the Kitchen area. They tried to go east but were told they need to open the screen door first. The current score is 5/7, and they're asking if they're on the right track and what their next move should be.

First, I need to recall the previous steps. The player opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the Kitchen. Now, in the Kitchen, there's a closed screen door leading east. The user tried to go east but was blocked. The correct action here is to open the screen door first.

The user's question is whether they're close to the goal. The original goal was to retrieve the apple from the garden, sit it on the stove, and win. So far, they've completed the steps up to opening the wooden door and entering the Kitchen. The next steps mentioned in the initial instructions were to make sure the screen door is open, then go east, then south, retrieve the apple, etc. So, the next logical step is to open the screen door.

The user's next action should be to open the screen door. The correct command would be "open screen door". After that, they can proceed east as allowed.

You scan the room for a set of chairs, and you find a set of chairs. The set of chairs appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You see a bbq. The bbq is normal. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio table. The patio table is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, the user is stuck in the Garden area. They tried to take the apple from the floor multiple times, but it's not working. Let me check the game state again.

In the Garden, the description says there's a lettuce, a tomato plant, an apple, and a shovel on the floor. Wait, maybe the apple is hidden or not immediately visible. The user tried "take apple from floor" but got "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the apple isn't on the floor as described. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is just "take apple" without specifying the floor. Or perhaps the apple is in a different location, like on the patio table in the Backyard, but that's not mentioned here.

Looking back at the previous steps: the user went from Kitchen to Backyard, then to Garden. In the Garden, the apple is on the floor. But the game's response says "You can't see any such thing" when trying to take it. Maybe the apple is actually on the patio table in the Backyard, but the user hasn't checked there yet. Alternatively, maybe the apple is in a different location. Wait, the Garden has the apple on the floor, but the user can't see it. Maybe the correct action is to look around or check the patio table. But the user's next action should be to take the apple from where it is. Since the game says it's on the floor, but the user can't see it, maybe the command should be "take apple" without specifying the floor. Alternatively, maybe the apple is in a different spot. But according to the game's description, the apple is on the floor. So perhaps the user needs to use the correct command. The previous attempts used "take apple from floor", which isn't working. Maybe the correct command is just "take apple". Let me check the game's previous messages. The user tried "take apple from floor" multiple times, but it's not working. The game's response is "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the apple isn't there, or the command is wrong. Wait, the game says "there is a lettuce, a tomato plant, an apple and a shovel on the floor." So the apple is on the floor. But the user can't see it. Maybe the correct command is "take apple" without the "from floor" part. Let me try that. The user's next action should be "take apple".

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Bathroom. They've been going back and forth between them. The original goal was to retrieve the apple from the garden, put it on the stove in the kitchen, and win. The user successfully took the apple from the garden and is now in the kitchen. But they keep going north to the bathroom and south back to the kitchen, which isn't helping.

The key step is to sit the apple on the stove in the kitchen. The user has the apple, so they need to go to the kitchen's stove. But in the current game state, the kitchen's stove is described as standard but empty. The user must place the apple there. However, the previous attempts to interact with the stove didn't work. Maybe the correct command is to "put apple on stove" or "sit apple on stove". The user hasn't done that yet. Instead, they're wandering around unnecessarily. The score is stuck at 9, so they need to complete the final step. The next action should be to put the apple on the stove in the kitchen.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is really stuck here. They have the apple but can't place it on the stove. The game keeps saying "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the apple isn't in their inventory? Wait, earlier they took the apple from the garden, so it should be with them. But in the current location, the bathroom, there's no stove mentioned. The stove is in the kitchen. So maybe they need to go back to the kitchen first. But they keep going between kitchen and bathroom. The correct step is to go back to the kitchen, then put the apple on the stove. The user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to go south back to the kitchen, then put the apple on the stove.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just shown up in a kitchen.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a refrigerator. You make out a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You make out a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.
