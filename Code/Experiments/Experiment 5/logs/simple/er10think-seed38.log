Welcome to TextWorld! First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After pulling open the antique trunk, recover the old key from the antique trunk within the bedroom. Then, insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. And then, ensure that the wooden door is open. And then, make an effort to head east. After that, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. After that, go to the east. And then, make an attempt to take a trip south. Following that, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. If you have picked up the milk, venture north. And then, go west. And then, sit the milk on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. The room is well lit.

You can make out a chest drawer. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an antique trunk. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld. The goal seems to be to follow a series of steps to reach a certain outcome, probably escaping or completing a task.

First, the user started in the bedroom. They opened the antique trunk, took the old key, and used it to unlock the wooden door. But the game is saying that the door is locked, even though they just unlocked it. That's confusing. Wait, maybe the door is locked, and unlocking it requires inserting the key and then turning it? But the user just inserted the key and unlocked it, but the game says it's still locked. Maybe there's a step missing here.

The user tried to go east after unlocking the door, but the game says they have to open the door first. But they just unlocked it. Maybe "unlock" and "open" are different actions here. In some games, you have to unlock a door and then open it. So maybe after unlocking, they need to open the door explicitly.

Looking at the previous steps: the user inserted the key into the lock and unlocked the door. But the game's response says "That's unlocked at the moment." So maybe the door is unlocked but not open yet. So the next step would be to open the door. But the user tried to go east before opening it, which is why the game is prompting again.

So the correct action here is to open the door after unlocking it. The user might have confused "unlock" with "open." So the next step should be to open the wooden door. Let me check the previous commands. The user tried "go east" but was told to open the door first. So the next action should be "open wooden door" to proceed.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow specific steps to progress. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and then tried to go east. But the game keeps prompting them to open the wooden door first, even though they just unlocked it. Maybe there's a confusion between unlocking and opening the door.

The user then tried to double-check the screen door, but the game doesn't recognize that as a valid command. The user tried "open screen door" but the game says they can't see it. So maybe there's no screen door in the current location. The user is in the bedroom, and the only door mentioned is the wooden door leading east. The screen door might be in another part of the map, but the user hasn't explored that yet.

The user's next step should be to move east after the wooden door is open. But since the game is prompting again about the screen door, maybe there's a misunderstanding. The original instructions mentioned checking the screen door after unlocking the wooden door. However, if there's no screen door here, perhaps the user needs to proceed to the next room (east) and then look for the screen door there. Alternatively, maybe the screen door is part of the bedroom, but the user hasn't noticed it yet.

The user's previous action was trying to open the screen door, which isn't present. So the correct next step would be to go east through the wooden door, then check if the screen door is there. But the game is still prompting about the screen door, so maybe the user needs to confirm that the screen door is open in the current room. However, since the user can't see it, they might need to explore the east room first.

So the next action should be to go east, then check the screen door there. But the user is stuck in the bedroom. The game might be expecting them to proceed east even though the screen door isn't present. Alternatively, maybe the screen door is part of the wooden door, and the user needs to open it properly. But the user already unlocked the wooden door, so maybe they need to open it and then check the screen door in the next room.

In any case, the user needs to move east to proceed. The correct command would be "go east" to enter the next room and then handle the screen door there. The game might be testing if the user can navigate correctly despite the confusion with the screen door.

-= Kitchen =-
You have walked into the most ordinary of all possible kitchens. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You see a refrigerator. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a counter. The counter appears to be empty. Look over there! a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Classic TextWorld.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

You find yourself in a backyard. A normal kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a set of chairs. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a set of chairs in a room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a bbq. The bbq is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You make out a patio table. The patio table is ordinary. The patio table appears to be empty.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is trying to follow the game's instructions but is stuck on the "lift milk from the floor" command. The game keeps saying "You can't see any such thing." Let me check the current location. The user is in the Garden, and the description mentions a half of a bag of chips, a milk, a bell pepper, and a shovel on the floor. So the milk is present.

The user has tried "lift milk from floor" multiple times, but the game doesn't recognize it. Maybe the correct verb is "take" instead of "lift". In text adventures, "take" is commonly used to pick up items. The user might have used "lift" instead of "take". Let me try changing the command to "take milk from floor" again. Wait, the user already tried that and got "You can't see any such thing." Hmm, maybe the item is named differently. The description says "a milk" on the floor. Maybe the correct command is "take milk" without specifying the floor, since the user is already in the garden. Alternatively, maybe the item is called "milk bottle" or something else. But according to the game's description, it's just "a milk". 

Wait, the user's previous attempt was "take milk from floor", but the game says it's not visible. Maybe the item is not on the floor but somewhere else. Wait, the description says "on the floor" so it should be there. Maybe the game expects the command "take milk" without the "from floor" part. Let me try that. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "get milk". But the user has to follow the exact verbs the game recognizes. Since the user tried "lift" and "take", but the game didn't accept them, maybe the correct verb is "get". Let me try "get milk" next. If that doesn't work, perhaps the game expects "pick up milk". But the user has to guess the right command. Since the user is stuck, the next step is to try "take milk" again, as that's the most common verb for picking up items. Alternatively, maybe the game requires the user to first check the floor, but the user is already in the garden. I think the correct command here is "take milk" without specifying the floor, so the user should try that.

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. A normal kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a set of chairs. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a set of chairs in a room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a bbq. The bbq is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You make out a patio table. The patio table is ordinary. The patio table appears to be empty.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been moving around the house, following the steps given. They started in the bedroom, opened the trunk, got the key, unlocked the door, and then went east to the kitchen, then to the backyard, garden, and back. They picked up the milk in the garden. Now they're in the bathroom, going back and forth between the kitchen and bathroom.

The original goal was to follow a series of steps: open the trunk, get the key, unlock the door, go east, check the screen door, go east again, try to go south, pick up the milk, then go north and west, and put the milk on the stove. But the user got stuck on the milk part because the game didn't recognize "lift" or "take milk from floor". Then they managed to take the milk once, and now they're back in the kitchen.

Wait, the user's current location is the bathroom, and they just tried to go north again. The available commands include 'go south' to return to the kitchen. The next step after taking the milk was to go north to the living room, but maybe they got lost in loops. The original plan was after picking up the milk, go north, then west, then put the milk on the stove. But the user is now in the bathroom, so maybe they need to go back to the kitchen, then to the living room, then find the stove.

But in the kitchen, there's a stove mentioned. The user has the milk in their inventory. So the next step would be to go from the bathroom back to the kitchen, then to the living room, and then put the milk on the stove. However, the user is currently in the bathroom, so the correct command is 'go south' to return to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, go north to the living room. Once there, they can go west to the kitchen again, but the stove is in the kitchen. Wait, the stove is in the kitchen, so after taking the milk, they need to go back to the kitchen and put the milk on the stove.

But the user is in the bathroom, so the next step is to go south to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, go north to the living room, then west to the kitchen again. But the stove is in the kitchen. So once in the kitchen, they can put the milk on the stove. So the correct sequence is: go south from bathroom to kitchen, then go north to living room, then west to kitchen, then put milk on stove. But the user is at the bathroom, so the immediate next command is 'go south' to get back to the kitchen.
