I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First off, assure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. And then, take the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. Once you have got the old key, doublecheck that the wooden door is unlocked. And then, open the wooden door. Once you have pulled open the wooden door, attempt to venture east. That done, make sure that the refrigerator is open. Then, recover the lettuce from the refrigerator in the kitchen. If you can get your hands on the lettuce, place the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just walked into a bedroom.

You can see a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. What's that over there? It looks like it's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see a refrigerator. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the TextWorld game. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east into the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, they need to proceed with the next steps.

The original goal was to get the lettuce from the refrigerator, place it on the stove, and win. So far, they've reached the kitchen. The current room is the kitchen, and the next steps mentioned in the initial instructions were: make sure the refrigerator is open, recover the lettuce, place it on the stove.

Looking at the current description of the kitchen: there's a refrigerator, a counter, a stove, a kitchen island with a note. The user needs to open the refrigerator. The next action should be to open the refrigerator. Then, take the lettuce from inside. After that, go to the stove and place the lettuce there. But the user's next move should be the immediate next step after arriving in the kitchen. Since the user just entered the kitchen, the first thing to do is open the refrigerator. The user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next command is "open refrigerator".
