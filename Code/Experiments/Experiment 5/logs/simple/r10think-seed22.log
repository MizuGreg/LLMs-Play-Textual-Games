Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to open the chest drawer within the bedroom. After that, recover the old key from the chest drawer. Then, unlock the wooden door within the bedroom. And then, assure that the wooden door is ajar. After opening the wooden door, attempt to move east. Then, make sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is ajar. After pulling open the screen door, take a trip east. Following that, make an effort to venture south. With that accomplished, pick up the milk from the floor of the garden. Then, head north. Next, try to go west. With that accomplished, rest the milk on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A standard one.

Were you looking for a chest drawer? Because look over there, it's a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. Look over there! a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, but tried to push it open and failed. Now, they're at a point where they need to make sure the door is ajar.

Wait, the previous step was trying to push the wooden door open, but the game said they can't see any such thing. Then they tried to unlock the door again, but it's already unlocked. The next step according to the original instructions was to assure the wooden door is ajar. Since the door is already unlocked, maybe they need to open it manually. But the user tried to push it and it didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to open the door instead of pushing? Or perhaps there's another step needed.

Looking back at the original instructions: after unlocking the door, they need to "assure that the wooden door is ajar." So maybe the door is unlocked but not open. The user tried to push it, which might not be the right action. The correct action might be to open the door. But in text adventures, sometimes "open" is the command. Alternatively, maybe "push" is the right verb here. But the game said "You can't see any such thing" when they tried to push. That might mean that pushing isn't the right action. Maybe they need to use the key again? But the door is already unlocked. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the door is locked but they've already unlocked it. Wait, the user had to unlock the door with the key, and then the door is unlocked. Now, they need to open it. So the next step is to open the door. The game might expect the command "open wooden door" instead of pushing. Let me check the previous steps. The user tried "push wooden door open" and it failed. So maybe the correct action is "open wooden door". Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, pushed it open, then went east to the kitchen. Then they had to open the screen door, which they did, and then went east again to the backyard.

Now, the current location is the backyard. The next step according to the original plan was to venture south from the backyard. The user's last action was moving east to the backyard, and now they need to go south. The backyard has an unblocked exit to the south, so that should be possible. The next step is to go south, then pick up the milk from the garden, head north, go west, rest the milk on the stove, and then win. So the next command should be 'go south'.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, moved east into the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, and then into the garden. In the garden, they need to pick up the milk from the floor.

The user has tried "take milk from floor" and "pick up milk from floor", but both times the system responded that it only understood the latter part. The correct command here is likely "pick up milk from floor" since the game might be expecting that exact phrasing. However, the user is getting feedback that it's not working. Maybe the game is case-sensitive or uses a different verb. Alternatively, maybe the milk is already in the inventory, and the user needs to move north next as per the earlier hint.

Wait, the user's last action was in the garden, where the milk is on the floor. The correct command should be "pick up milk from floor" but the system is not accepting it. The user might need to use "take milk from floor" instead. Alternatively, maybe the game expects "get milk" or another verb. But the user has tried "pick up" and "take" without success. 

Looking back at the game's previous interactions, the user was told "You can't see any such thing" when they tried "take milk from floor", but then "I only understood you as far as wanting to pick up the milk" when they used "pick up". The system might be expecting a different command. Maybe the correct command is "get milk" or "take milk". Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to move to the milk's location first, but the milk is already in the garden. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north after picking up the milk. The game's prompt in the garden says "You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded." So after picking up the milk, the next step is to go north. But the user is stuck on picking up the milk. 

Since the user is getting feedback that their commands aren't working, maybe the correct command is "pick up milk" without specifying "from floor", but the game might require the exact phrase. Alternatively, the game might have a different way of handling items. The user might need to use "take milk" instead of "pick up". 

But the user has tried both and got no success. The next step would be to try "go north" after picking up the milk, but the user is stuck on the milk. So the correct action here is to try "pick up milk from floor" again, even though the system says it's not understood. Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting "get milk from floor". 

Alternatively, maybe the user should try "look at milk" to confirm its location, but the game might not have that command. Given the previous responses, the user needs to use "pick up milk from floor" again, even though the system says it's not understood. The user might need to proceed to the next step, which is going north, but that's after picking up the milk. 

So the next action should be to pick up the milk, even if the system is not accepting it, and then go north. But the user is stuck on the milk. Therefore, the correct command is "pick up milk from floor".

Okay, the user is stuck in the Garden scene trying to pick up the milk. They've tried "pick up milk from floor" multiple times, but the game keeps responding that it only understood the part about picking up the milk. Maybe the correct command is just "take milk" or "get milk" without specifying the floor. Let me check the previous interactions.

In the Garden description, the milk is on the floor. The user has tried "take milk from floor" and "pick up milk from floor", but the game isn't recognizing it. Perhaps the game expects a simpler command like "take milk" or "get milk". Alternatively, maybe "pick up milk" without mentioning the floor. The user might need to use the correct verb form that the game accepts. Since the game's response indicates it's only understanding the intent to pick up the milk, maybe the floor part is redundant. Let me try suggesting "take milk" as the next action.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been navigating through different rooms in the house, following a series of steps to complete the game. The main goal is to pick up the milk from the garden, then rest it on the stove. So far, they've managed to open the chest drawer, get the key, unlock and open the door, move east to the kitchen, open the screen door, go to the backyard, find the milk, and pick it up. But then they got stuck again in the garden, trying to pick up the milk, and the game kept saying it couldn't understand the command. Finally, they managed to pick up the milk once, and now they're back in the kitchen.

Now, the next step according to the original plan was to head north after picking up the milk. But the user is in the kitchen again, and the next action should be to go north. However, going north from the kitchen leads to the bathroom, and then back to the kitchen. This seems like a loop. The user might be stuck in a cycle between the kitchen and bathroom. 

But the original goal was to rest the milk on the stove. The user has the milk, so they need to go to the stove. The stove is in the kitchen. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, so maybe they can just go to the stove. But the game's description says the stove is normal but empty. So maybe they need to put the milk on it. However, the game might require specific commands. 

Looking back, after picking up the milk in the garden, the user went north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen, then north to the bathroom, then south back to the kitchen. Now, they need to find the stove in the kitchen and put the milk there. The command would be to go to the stove or put the milk on the stove. But the game's previous responses might not accept "put" as a command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go to the stove's location and then use the milk there.

But the user's last action was going north from the kitchen, which led to the bathroom. Now, they need to go back to the stove. Since the stove is in the kitchen, the user should go south from the bathroom to get back to the kitchen, then go to the stove. But the user is in the bathroom again. So the next step is to go south to the kitchen, then go to the stove. However, the user's current position is in the bathroom, so the next command should be "go south" to return to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, they can go to the stove. But the game might require specific commands like "go to stove" or "put milk on stove".

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go to the stove directly. Since the user is in the kitchen, they can just "go to stove" or "go to the stove". But the game's previous responses might not accept that. The user might need to use the correct command structure. The correct next step is to go to the stove in the kitchen and put the milk there. So the user should first go to the stove, then use the milk. But the user is in the bathroom, so they need to go back to the kitchen first. Therefore, the next command should be "go south" to return to the kitchen, then "go to stove" or "go to the stove".

Okay, let's see. The user has been going back and forth between the kitchen, bathroom, and backyard. They've picked up the milk, but they're stuck in a loop between the kitchen and bathroom. The original goal was to follow a series of steps: open the chest drawer, get the key, unlock the door, open it, go east, check the screen door, then proceed through the kitchen, backyard, garden, etc., finally resting the milk on the stove.

But right now, they're stuck in a loop between the kitchen and bathroom. The score is at 9/26, which suggests they've done most of the early steps but are now stuck in a cycle. The milk was picked up in the garden, but they need to get back to the kitchen to put it on the stove. However, their last actions were going north and south between the kitchen and bathroom, which doesn't help.

The key is to get back to the kitchen from the bathroom. Since the bathroom has a south exit back to the kitchen, they need to go south from the bathroom. But the user has been repeatedly going north and south between those two rooms. The correct path is to go from the bathroom south to the kitchen, then from the kitchen east to the backyard, then north to the garden, and finally put the milk on the stove.

But the user's last action was going north again, which is incorrect. They need to go south from the bathroom to the kitchen, then proceed east from the kitchen to the backyard, then north to the garden, and then put the milk on the stove. However, the user might not be aware of the correct path and is stuck in a loop. The next correct action after being in the bathroom is to go south to the kitchen, then proceed east to the backyard, then north to the garden, and finally put the milk on the stove. But the user's last action was going north again, so they need to correct that and go south instead.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to win. The current score is 9 out of 34, and they've been moving between rooms like the kitchen, bathroom, living room, etc. The main goal is to complete all the tasks listed at the beginning.

Looking at the latest prompt, the user is in the kitchen again, and the instruction says to go north. But when they tried going north before, they ended up in the bathroom. The user has been oscillating between the kitchen and bathroom, going back and forth. The score hasn't increased much, so maybe they're stuck in a loop.

The original tasks include picking up the milk from the garden, then heading north, then west, and putting the milk on the stove. But the user has already picked up the milk in the garden (score increased to 9). Now they need to head north from the garden, which they did, leading them to the backyard, then to the kitchen. But they keep getting stuck in the kitchen and bathroom loop.

Maybe the issue is that after picking up the milk, they need to go north from the garden, which they did, but then they have to go west from the kitchen, which leads to the bathroom, and then south back to the kitchen. This back-and-forth is causing them to not make progress towards the final steps, like putting the milk on the stove.

The user's next action should be to go west from the kitchen, as per the original plan. But since they keep getting stuck in the kitchen and bathroom, they need to find a way to proceed. The key might be to eventually reach the stove in the kitchen and put the milk on it. However, the game's environment might not allow direct interaction with the stove unless they're in the right place.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the garden, but they've already completed that part. The final step is to put the milk on the stove, which is in the kitchen. So once they're in the kitchen, they should be able to interact with the stove. But in the current game state, they're stuck in the kitchen and bathroom loop, so they need to break that cycle and proceed to the stove.

The correct next action would be to go west from the kitchen, which leads to the bathroom, then south back to the kitchen, and then interact with the stove. But since the user has been going back and forth, they need to focus on moving towards the stove and completing that task to win.

You see a refrigerator. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is usual. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a stove. The stove is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to win. The goal is to perform a specific sequence of actions: open the chest drawer, get the key, unlock the door, open it, go east, check the kitchen's screen door, go east again, go south, pick up the milk, head north, go west, put the milk on the stove, and then win.

Looking at the current state, the user has been moving between rooms, but they seem to be stuck in a loop between the kitchen, bathroom, and living room. The score is at 9 out of 40, which suggests they've completed most of the early steps but might be having trouble with the later ones. 

The last action was "go south" which took them back to the kitchen. The user is now at the kitchen again, and the prompt says they need to go north, but that leads back to the bathroom. The problem might be that they're not progressing towards the garden where the milk is located or the stove where they need to place the milk.

Wait, the user picked up the milk in the garden, but they might not have made it to the stove yet. The final step is to rest the milk on the stove. But in the current path, they've been moving between rooms without reaching the stove. Maybe they need to go back to the kitchen, then find the stove, and place the milk there.

But in the current state, the user is in the kitchen again. The kitchen has a stove, but the user hasn't interacted with it yet. The note on the kitchen island might be important. However, the user's last action was "go south" from the bathroom, leading back to the kitchen. They need to go north from the kitchen to the living room, then maybe find a way to the garden or the stove.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the kitchen to the bedroom, then east again to the kitchen, but that seems like it's just looping. The key steps that are left are placing the milk on the stove. The user has the milk, so they need to go to the stove. But in the current setup, the stove is in the kitchen. So perhaps the user needs to go to the stove in the kitchen and put the milk there.

But in the previous steps, the user was in the kitchen, and the stove is mentioned as being empty. So maybe the user needs to go to the stove, put the milk there, and then win. However, the user hasn't done that yet. The current location is the kitchen, so the next step should be to go to the stove and place the milk. But the user's last action was "go south" which led them back to the kitchen. So the next action should be to go to the stove, then put the milk there.

But the user's previous attempts to go north and south have been leading them in circles. The correct path would be to go from the kitchen to the living room, then maybe find a way to the garden or the stove. However, the stove is in the kitchen, so maybe they just need to go to the stove in the kitchen and place the milk there. The user has the milk, so the next step is to go to the stove and put it there. Therefore, the correct command would be to go to the stove, then put the milk.
