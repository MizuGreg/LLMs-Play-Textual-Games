Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to ensure that the chest drawer is open. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. Then, make it so that the wooden door is ajar. And then, attempt to go to the east. Then, open the screen door. And then, travel east. With that done, make an effort to travel south. And then, retrieve the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. Then, make an attempt to move north. With that accomplished, head west. With that done, place the half of a bag of chips on the stove. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You've seen better bedrooms, but at least this one seems pretty normal.

You see a chest drawer. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. A closed antique trunk is nearby. You can make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and tried to make the door ajar. But the system is rejecting some commands because they're not valid verbs.

First, I need to recall the correct commands allowed in the game. The user tried "door is ajar" and "ajar wooden door", which aren't valid. The correct action after unlocking the door would be to "open" the door, but since it's already unlocked, maybe "push" or "pull" is needed. Wait, the game might require specific verbs. Let me check the previous interactions.

Earlier, the user said "unlock wooden door" which worked. Now, the door is unlocked but maybe not open. The next step is to open it. The correct command might be "open wooden door". But the user tried "door is ajar" which is a state, not an action. So the right action is to open the door. Let me confirm: after unlocking, the door is ajar, so maybe the user needs to "open" it. Alternatively, maybe "push" or "pull" is required. But the game's allowed verbs are likely "open" and "push". Since the user tried "door is ajar" and it was rejected, the correct action is to "open" the door. So the next command should be "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps in the TextWorld game. They've reached the Garden area, where they need to take the half of a bag of chips from the floor. But the system is saying they can't see any such thing. Wait, earlier in the Garden description, it mentioned "a half of a bag of chips, a tomato plant, a milk and a shovel on the floor." So the item is there. Maybe the user is trying to take it but the command isn't correct.

The user has tried "take half of a bag of chips from floor" three times, but it's not working. Maybe the correct command is just "take half of a bag of chips" without specifying the floor, since the item is on the floor by default. Or perhaps the game expects a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the item is named differently, like "half-bag-of-chips" or "chip half." But the user's command matches the description. Hmm.

Wait, the error message says "You can't see any such thing." But according to the game's description, the half of a bag of chips is present. Maybe there's a typo in the item's name. Let me check the exact wording again. The garden has "a half of a bag of chips" on the floor. So the user's command should be correct. Maybe the game is case-sensitive or has a different syntax. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "take" without the "from floor" part, since the item is already on the floor. Let me try that. The next action should be "take half of a bag of chips" without the "from floor" part. That might work. Let's try that command.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to put the half of a bag of chips on the stove. But the game says they can't see any such thing. Wait, in the Garden description, after going south, the items on the floor are tomato plant, milk, and shovel. The half of a bag of chips was taken earlier, so maybe it's not here anymore. Oh, right! The user took the chips from the garden, so now they're holding it. But the stove is in the kitchen, not the garden. Wait, the user is in the Garden now. The stove is in the Kitchen. So how do they get to the stove? They need to go back through the Backyard, then to the Kitchen. But the current location is Garden. The previous step was going south from Backyard to Garden. So the user needs to go north back to Backyard, then east to Kitchen, then find the stove. But the current command is trying to put the chips on the stove in the Garden, which doesn't exist here. So the correct action is to go back to the Kitchen where the stove is. So the next step should be to go north to Backyard, then east to Kitchen, then put the chips on the stove. But the user is in Garden, so first go north to Backyard. Then from Backyard, go east to Kitchen. Then in Kitchen, put the chips on the stove. But the user's current location is Garden, so the first command should be 'go north' to return to Backyard. Then proceed from there. So the next action is 'go north' to Backyard.
