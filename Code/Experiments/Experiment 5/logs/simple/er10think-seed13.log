I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be great if you could ensure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is open. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer. And then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. And then, make an attempt to go east. And then, open the screen door. After opening the screen door, make an effort to go to the east. Then, take a trip south. And then, retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the bell pepper, head north. Then, travel west. After that, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has followed a series of steps. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, retrieved the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and then opened it. Now they're at step 4/5.

The next step in the original instructions was to "make an attempt to go east." The user tried that, but maybe they got stuck or didn't proceed correctly. Then they had to open the screen door, go east again, take a trip south, retrieve the bell pepper, head north, travel west, and rest the bell pepper on the stove.

Wait, the current state after opening the wooden door (step 4/5) would be in the bedroom, with the door open. The next action should be to go east. But the user might have tried that already. Let me check the history.

Looking back, after opening the wooden door, the user's next action was to "make an attempt to go east." But the system message says to only output the action. However, the user might have tried "go east" and maybe failed, but in the current state, the wooden door is open. So the next step is to go east. But the user might need to open the screen door first. Wait, the original instructions said after opening the wooden door, make an attempt to go east. But maybe there's a screen door that needs to be opened first.

Wait, the original plan was: after opening the wooden door, go east. Then open the screen door, go east again. So maybe after opening the wooden door (step 4/5), the next action is to go east. But perhaps the user is in a room where going east leads to another door or a screen door. So the next command should be "go east". But the user might have tried that already. Alternatively, maybe the screen door is in the way. But according to the original plan, after opening the wooden door, they need to go east, then open the screen door, then go east again.

So the current step is after opening the wooden door (step 4/5), the next action is to "go east". The user's next command should be "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a refrigerator. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is ordinary. The stove appears to be empty. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

-= Backyard =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so ordinary all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the backyard. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see a set of chairs. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a set of chairs, go to TextWorld. The set of chairs is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You can see a patio table. Now why would someone leave that there? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user has reached the Garden area, which is step 8/9. The original goal was to retrieve the bell pepper, rest it on the stove, and probably proceed further. In the Garden, there's a bell pepper on the floor. The user's next action should be to take the bell pepper. Then, they need to go north to the kitchen where the stove is. So the next command is "take bell pepper".

Okay, the user is in the Backyard again after going north from the Garden. They picked up the bell pepper and now need to rest it on the stove. But the current location is the Backyard, so they need to go back to the Kitchen where the stove is. The previous steps were: Garden (step 9/10), then go north to Backyard (step 9/11). Now, the next action should be to go west to the Kitchen, then put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is in the Backyard, so the next command is "go west" to reach the Kitchen again.
