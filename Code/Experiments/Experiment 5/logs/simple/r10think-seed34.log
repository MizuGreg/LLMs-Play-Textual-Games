It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First step, open the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer in the bedroom. If you can get your hands on the old key, insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After that, travel east. Then, open the screen door. Then, go to the east. Then, attempt to travel south. If you can manage that, lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden. And then, head north. Then, try to travel west. Following that, rest the lettuce on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
Okay, so you're in a bedroom, cool, but is it standard? You better believe it is.

Hey, want to see a chest drawer? Look over there, a chest drawer. Oh, great. Here's an antique trunk. You see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You can see a closed refrigerator close by. You can make out a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well Were you looking for a kitchen island? Because look over there, it's a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out the next steps here. The user is in the Bathroom, and the previous actions have been moving through the house. The goal was to get the old key, unlock the door, and then proceed to the garden to lift the lettuce and put it on the stove.

So far, they've opened the chest drawer in the bedroom, taken the key, unlocked the door, went east to the kitchen, then went north to the bathroom. Now, they need to continue their journey. The next step mentioned in the original instructions was after going north in the kitchen, then trying to travel south to the garden. But in the current state, they're in the bathroom. The bathroom's description mentions a sink, a toilet, and a bath. The only door mentioned is south, which is unblocked.

Wait, the user's last action was "go north" from the kitchen to the bathroom. Now, in the bathroom, the instruction says to try going south. But the original plan was after the kitchen, go north, then south to the garden. But maybe the path is different. Let me check the previous steps again.

In the kitchen, after going north to the bathroom, the next logical step would be to go back south to continue towards the garden. But the user might have to navigate through the bathroom first. The original plan said after the kitchen, go north, then try to travel south. But in the current state, they are in the bathroom. So the next action should be to go south from the bathroom back to the kitchen, then proceed to the garden.

But the user's last action was "go north" to the bathroom. Now, in the bathroom, the only unblocked door is south. So the next step is to go south back to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, they can go south again to the garden. But the original instructions said after the kitchen, go north, then south. Wait, maybe there's a confusion here. Let me check the original steps again.

Original steps: After unlocking the door and going east to the kitchen, then go north, then try to travel south. But in the kitchen, going north leads to the bathroom. Then, from the bathroom, going south would return to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, going south would be to the garden. So the next action after the bathroom is to go south back to the kitchen, then proceed to the garden.

But the user is currently in the bathroom. The next action should be to go south. So the correct command is "go south".

Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to reach a goal. From the previous interactions, they've been moving between rooms: bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, and back and forth between them. The goal mentioned in the initial instructions was to lift the lettuce from the garden and then rest it on the stove, but so far, the user hasn't encountered the garden or the lettuce.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the kitchen, and the score is at 5/19. The previous actions involved opening doors, inserting a key, and moving between rooms. However, the user hasn't yet reached the garden where the lettuce is supposed to be. The next steps in the original plan were to travel east, then south, lift the lettuce, head north, west, and then rest it on the stove. But the current path seems to be looping between the kitchen and bathroom, which might not be part of the intended path.

The user's current position is the kitchen, and the available exits are north (bathroom) and south (unguarded exit). The original plan mentioned traveling south after reaching the garden, but since the garden hasn't been accessed yet, maybe the user needs to find another path. However, the current room descriptions don't mention a garden. Perhaps there's a mistake in the path, or maybe the garden is accessible through a different route not yet explored.

The user's score is low, indicating that they might not have completed the required steps. The original goal requires specific actions: opening the chest, taking the key, unlocking the door, moving east, opening the screen door, going east again, traveling south to get the lettuce, then north, west, and resting the lettuce on the stove. However, the current actions are repetitive between the kitchen and bathroom, which might not be part of the correct sequence.

Maybe the user needs to find the garden through a different door. The kitchen has a closed screen door leading east. If they go east from the kitchen, they might reach the garden. The initial instructions mentioned opening the screen door after traveling east. So, perhaps the next step should be to go east from the kitchen, open the screen door, and then proceed to the garden to lift the lettuce. But the user has been going back and forth between kitchen and bathroom, missing the opportunity to explore east.

The user's next action should be to go east from the kitchen, open the screen door, and then proceed to the garden. However, the current prompt says to only output the command, so the correct next step would be "go east" to reach the screen door and then open it. But in the previous steps, the user was moving north and south, which might not be the right direction. The original plan said after unlocking the door and going east, open the screen door, then go east again. So, perhaps the user needs to go east from the kitchen to access the garden.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to play this text-based game. They've been moving through different rooms: bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, backyard, and now the garden. The goal mentioned earlier was to lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden and then rest it on the stove. 

Looking at the current situation, the user is in the garden. The description says there's a lettuce on the floor. The user has tried to "lift lettuce from floor of garden" multiple times, but the system keeps saying it's not a recognized verb. Maybe the correct command is just "lift lettuce" without specifying the floor? Or perhaps "pick up lettuce"?

Wait, in the game's context, the previous action was "lift lettuce from floor of garden" which was rejected. The system might expect a simpler command. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden." Maybe the correct verb is "take" instead of "lift"? Or maybe "pick up"?

But the user has been using "lift" and the system is rejecting it. Maybe the game expects "take lettuce" or "get lettuce"? Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "lift lettuce" without the "from floor of garden" part, since the game might automatically recognize the location.

Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to first pick up the lettuce, then go to the stove. But the user's last action was trying to lift it, which failed. The user is now being asked if they're on the right track, so maybe they need to adjust the command. Since the system is not accepting "lift lettuce from floor of garden," maybe the correct command is just "lift lettuce" or "take lettuce."

But the user has tried "lift lettuce from floor of garden" multiple times, and it's not working. Maybe the game expects the user to use "take" instead. Let me think. In many text games, "take" is the verb used for picking up items. So maybe the correct command is "take lettuce." Alternatively, "get lettuce."

But the user's previous attempt was "lift lettuce from floor of garden," which was rejected. So perhaps the correct command is "take lettuce" or "get lettuce." The user might need to try that. Alternatively, maybe the game expects "pick up lettuce."

But the user is supposed to only output the command, nothing else. So the next step is to try a different verb. Since "lift" isn't working, maybe "take" is the right verb. So the next action should be "take lettuce."

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to achieve the goal. So far, they've managed to open the chest drawer, take the old key, unlock the door, and navigate through the kitchen, bathroom, backyard, and garden. They lifted the lettuce from the garden floor, which was a crucial step according to the initial instructions.

Now, the next step in the original plan was to "rest the lettuce on the stove." But the user is currently in the bathroom, having been redirected through a loop between the kitchen and bathroom. The score is at 9/31, which suggests they've completed most of the required actions but might be stuck in a loop.

The user's current location is the bathroom, and the prompt says to "rest the lettuce on the stove." However, the stove is in the kitchen, so they need to go back to the kitchen. The previous steps showed that after lifting the lettuce, they went north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen, and then back to the bathroom. The user is now in the bathroom again, so they need to go south to the kitchen again.

But the main task is to rest the lettuce on the stove. The user has the lettuce in their inventory (since they lifted it), so they need to go to the kitchen, find the stove, and place the lettuce there. The challenge is navigating back to the kitchen and ensuring they can interact with the stove.

Looking at the previous steps, the user has been moving between the kitchen and bathroom, so they need to go south from the bathroom to the kitchen again. Once in the kitchen, they can go to the stove and rest the lettuce. The key is to make sure they don't get stuck in the loop and instead proceed to the kitchen where the stove is located.

Therefore, the next action should be to go south from the bathroom to the kitchen, then proceed to the stove and place the lettuce there. Since the user is currently in the bathroom, the immediate next step is to go south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to complete objectives. So far, they've managed to open the chest drawer, take the old key, unlock the door, and navigate through several rooms. They've also lifted the lettuce from the garden. The current score is 9/36, which suggests there are still several steps left.

The user is now in the Kitchen again, with the option to go north, south, east, or west. The goal mentioned earlier was to rest the lettuce on the stove. The user has the lettuce, so the next logical step would be to go to the stove. However, the stove is in the kitchen, and the user is already there. But the stove is described as having nothing on it. So maybe they need to go to the stove's location and place the lettuce there.

Wait, the user has the lettuce, so they need to go to the stove. The current room is the kitchen, and the stove is mentioned as being there. But the user hasn't interacted with the stove yet. The previous step was lifting the lettuce, so the next step should be to go to the stove and put the lettuce on it. However, the available commands are to go in different directions. The stove is in the kitchen, so maybe the user is already in the right place. The next action would be to rest the lettuce on the stove. But the game might require the user to first go to the stove's location, which is already in the kitchen. So the correct command here is to rest the lettuce on the stove. But the user has to make sure they are in the correct room. Since they are in the kitchen, the next step is to put the lettuce on the stove. However, the game's previous interactions show that the user has to use specific commands. The correct command here would be "rest lettuce on stove" or similar. But the user's previous actions have been "go north", "go south", etc. So maybe the next step is to go to the stove's location, which is already in the kitchen. Therefore, the correct action is to rest the lettuce on the stove.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete the game, and they've reached the kitchen again. They have the lettuce in their inventory, as they lifted it from the garden. The next step according to the original instructions was to rest the lettuce on the stove. But the game is rejecting "rest lettuce on stove" as not a recognized verb.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is different. Let me think about possible verbs related to placing something on the stove. Instead of "rest," maybe "put" is the right verb. So instead of "rest lettuce on stove," it should be "put lettuce on stove." Alternatively, maybe "place" is the correct verb. But the game might have specific commands. Let me check the previous interactions.

Earlier, the user tried "lift lettuce from floor of garden" and it worked. So "lift" was correct. Then, "rest lettuce on stove" is the next step. But the game says it's not a recognized verb. Maybe the correct command is "put" instead of "rest." Let me try that. The user might need to use "put lettuce on stove" instead. Alternatively, maybe "place lettuce on stove." But the game's response indicates that "rest" isn't valid. So the correct action is likely "put." Let me confirm by checking the possible verbs in the kitchen description. The stove is mentioned, and the user has the lettuce. So the correct command should be "put lettuce on stove." That's the next action the user needs to take.
