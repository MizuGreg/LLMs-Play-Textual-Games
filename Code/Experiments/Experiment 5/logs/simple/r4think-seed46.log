Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be great if you could make sure that the antique trunk is opened. After that, pick up the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. After unlocking the wooden door, doublecheck that the wooden door is wide open. Then, try to go to the east. With that accomplished, ensure that the refrigerator within the kitchen is open. And then, retrieve the milk from the refrigerator inside the kitchen. And then, rest the milk on the stove. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal kind of place.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You scan the room for a king-size bed, and you find a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've already done a few steps. The goal is to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock the door, open the door, go east, open the fridge, get milk, put it on the stove, and win.

So far, they've opened the trunk, picked up the key, unlocked the door. The next step according to the original instructions was to double-check that the door is wide open. But the user's last action was unlocking the door, and the system message says they're at 3/4. Wait, the original plan was after unlocking, double-check the door is open. Then go east. Then proceed to the kitchen.

But the user's last action was "unlock wooden door", which succeeded. Now, the next logical step would be to check if the door is open. The user might need to verify that the door is indeed wide open. So the next action should be to open the door, but maybe the system already does that. Wait, the user has to make sure the door is open. So maybe the next command is "open wooden door" or "push wooden door" to make sure it's fully open. Alternatively, maybe the game requires the player to check the state of the door. But in the game's context, after unlocking, the door might be locked, so they need to open it. But the user has already unlocked it. So perhaps the next step is to open the door. But the user's next action should be to check if the door is open. However, the user's next step in the original plan was to "doublecheck that the wooden door is wide open." So the correct action here is to open the door. But how? Maybe the command is "open wooden door". Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the bedroom, and the wooden door leads east. After unlocking, they need to open it. So the next action should be "open wooden door". But the user might have to push it. Alternatively, the game might have a "push" command. But according to the previous steps, the user has to make sure the door is open. So the next action is to open the door. Therefore, the correct command is "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the antique trunk, pick up the key, unlock the wooden door, and now they've opened it. The next step according to the original instructions was to go east. But the user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to winning.

So, after opening the door, the next logical step would be to move east as mentioned. But the user is in the bedroom, and the door leads east. Wait, the previous action was opening the wooden door, which was leading east. So now, the next action should be to go east. But the user is asking for confirmation. The assistant's job is to check if the actions so far are correct. The user has completed the steps up to opening the door, so the next step is to go east. Then, after that, they need to go to the kitchen, open the fridge, get milk, put it on the stove, and win. So yes, the user is on the right track. The next action should be to go east.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a refrigerator. You see a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing is empty. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island. Now that's what I call TextWorld!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user has to open the refrigerator in the kitchen and get the milk. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, picked up the key, unlocked the door, opened the door, and went east to the kitchen. Now they're in the kitchen, and the next step is to open the refrigerator.

The current location is the kitchen. The user needs to open the refrigerator. The prompt mentions that the refrigerator is closed. So the next action should be to open the refrigerator. Let me check the previous steps again to make sure I'm not missing anything. The user has to retrieve the milk from the fridge after opening it. So the correct command here is "open refrigerator". But wait, in the kitchen description, the refrigerator is mentioned as "closed". So yes, the user needs to open it. The next step after opening the fridge would be to take the milk. But the current task is to first open the fridge. So the next action is "open refrigerator".

Okay, let's see. The user has to retrieve the milk from the refrigerator and then put it on the stove. So far, they've opened the refrigerator and found both milk and lettuce. The next step is to pick up the milk. Once they have the milk, they need to go to the stove and put it there. The user's last action was opening the refrigerator, so the next command should be to take the milk. Then, they need to go to the stove, which is mentioned in the kitchen description. After that, put the milk on the stove. Let me check the previous steps again to make sure I don't miss anything. The user is in the kitchen now, so the next action is definitely taking the milk.

Okay, the user has to rest the milk on the stove. Let me check the current location. They're in the kitchen, and there's a stove mentioned. The previous action was taking the milk from the refrigerator. Now, the next step is to put the milk on the stove. The command should be "rest milk on stove". But wait, the system might expect a specific phrase. Let me make sure. The user's goal was to rest the milk on the stove after retrieving it. So the correct command is "rest milk on stove". I need to output that exactly.

Okay, the user tried to "rest milk on stove" but the game didn't recognize it. Let me think about the possible correct actions here. The milk is in hand, and the stove is in the kitchen. The goal is to rest the milk on the stove. Maybe the correct command is "put milk on stove" or "place milk on stove". Since "rest" isn't a valid verb here, I should suggest the correct phrasing. The user needs to use a verb that the game accepts. So the next action should be "put milk on stove".
