Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be good if you could open the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. With the old key, unlock the wooden door. Then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. After that, make an effort to head east. If you can accomplish that, open the refrigerator inside the kitchen. After that, recover the lettuce from the refrigerator in the kitchen. After that, rest the lettuce on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. Let's see what's in here.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You see an antique trunk. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps to open the chest drawer, take the old key, unlock the wooden door, and now the door is unlocked. The next step according to the original task was to ensure the wooden door is open. Since they just unlocked it, maybe they need to check if it's open. But the game might automatically consider it open after unlocking. Then, the next action was to head east. So after unlocking, the next step is to go east. The user's next action should be "go east" to proceed to the kitchen. Let me confirm the previous steps: the user has unlocked the door, so now they need to move east. The next step in the task is to open the refrigerator in the kitchen. So the correct command here is "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the game because they tried to go east but the wooden door isn't open. They already unlocked it but maybe didn't open it yet. Wait, the previous steps: they opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door. But the door might still be locked even though they unlocked it. Wait, the game message said "You unlock wooden door" but maybe unlocking isn't the same as opening. Oh, right! The user needs to open the door after unlocking. So the next step should be to open the door. But the user tried to go east again, which is why the game says they need to open the door first. So the correct action is to open the wooden door again. Let me check the previous messages. The user tried to go east, but the game said they need to open the door first. Then they tried to unlock it again, but the game said it's already unlocked. So maybe the door is locked but they have the key. Wait, maybe the door was unlocked but not opened. So the correct action is to open the door. The user needs to open the door after unlocking it. So the next command should be "open wooden door".

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

A closed refrigerator is here. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. The counter is ordinary. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly infuriated by your TextWorld experience. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island, so there's that.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to rest the lettuce on the stove. The previous action was taking the lettuce from the refrigerator. Now, they tried to "rest lettuce on stove" but got an error because "rest" isn't a recognized verb here.

Hmm, in TextWorld games, actions usually involve verbs like "put", "place", or "rest" might not be directly applicable. The correct action here would likely be "put" the lettuce on the stove. Let me check the available actions in the kitchen description again. The kitchen has a stove, so the player needs to place the lettuce there. Since "rest" isn't working, the right command should be "put lettuce on stove". That makes sense. So the next action should be "put lettuce on stove".
