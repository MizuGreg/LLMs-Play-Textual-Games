Welcome to another exciting round of TextWorld! First of all, ensure that the antique trunk is open. After opening the antique trunk, take the old key from the antique trunk. And then, unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with the old key. And then, open the wooden door. Then, make an attempt to travel east. Okay, and then, doublecheck that the refrigerator is wide open. Once you have opened the refrigerator, take the bell pepper from the refrigerator. After that, rest the bell pepper on the stove inside the kitchen. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a bedroom.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a chest drawer. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You see an antique trunk. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld. The goal is to follow a series of steps: open the antique trunk, take the old key, unlock the wooden door in the bedroom, open it, then go east, check the refrigerator, take a bell pepper, put it on the stove in the kitchen.

So far, the user has opened the antique trunk and taken the old key. The next step was to unlock the wooden door with the old key. But the user's input was "unlock wooden door in bedroom with old key", which the system didn't understand. The user then asked if they're on the right track and what their next action should be.

First, I need to figure out the correct command. In text adventures, commands are usually concise. The correct syntax might be "unlock wooden door with old key" or "use old key on wooden door". The previous action was "take old key from antique trunk", so the next logical step is to use that key to unlock the door.

The user's confusion might be due to the phrasing. The system might expect a more direct command. So the next action should be to unlock the door using the old key. The correct command is likely "unlock wooden door with old key".

Then, after unlocking, the door would be open, so the next step is to open it. But the user's next action should be the correct command to unlock the door. The user's previous attempt was "unlock wooden door in bedroom with old key", which might have been too wordy. The system might require a shorter command.

So the correct next action is "unlock wooden door with old key".

Okay, the user is in a text adventure game and needs to follow specific steps. Let me recap the current progress. They've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door in the bedroom, and opened it. Now they need to travel east. The next step in the original goal was to "make an attempt to travel east" after opening the door. So the correct command here would be "go east". The user has to make sure they use the correct command format. Since the previous actions were "open antique trunk", "take old key from antique trunk", "unlock wooden door with old key", "open wooden door", the next logical step is moving east. The user's next action should be "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen.

You make out a closed refrigerator. You can see a counter. The counter is typical. The counter appears to be empty. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, the user is in a text adventure game. Let me see where they are. They've opened the refrigerator and found a bell pepper and an apple. The next step according to the original goal was to take the bell pepper from the refrigerator. So the correct command here would be "take bell pepper from refrigerator". The user previously tried "doublecheck refrigerator is wide open", which wasn't a valid command, so they tried "open refrigerator" instead. Now, after opening, they need to take the bell pepper. The command should be straightforward. Make sure to use the exact phrasing the game expects. The next action is taking the bell pepper.

Okay, the user is trying to rest the bell pepper on the stove. The previous command "rest bell pepper on stove inside kitchen" didn't work. The game might not recognize "rest" as a valid verb. Instead, the correct action might be "put bell pepper on stove". Let me check the possible commands. In text adventures, "put" is a common verb for placing items. So the next action should be "put bell pepper on stove".
