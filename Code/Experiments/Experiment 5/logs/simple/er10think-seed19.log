Welcome to another life changing episode of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, doublecheck that the chest drawer is opened. Once you have opened the chest drawer, recover the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, unlock the wooden door. Then, open the wooden door. Once you have opened the wooden door, attempt to go to the east. With that accomplished, make absolutely sure that the refrigerator within the kitchen is ajar. Then, pick up the milk from the refrigerator. After taking the milk, sit the milk on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You make out a chest drawer. You see a closed antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. This always happens, here in TextWorld!

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. The room is well lit.

Oh, great. Here's a refrigerator. You make out a counter. The counter is ordinary. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island. Huh, weird.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me see. The user has been through the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, got the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east into the kitchen. The current location is the kitchen. The task was to make sure the refrigerator is ajar, then pick up the milk, sit it on the stove.

In the kitchen, the user sees a refrigerator, a counter, a stove, a kitchen island with a note. The refrigerator's status is mentioned as "closed" in the description. Wait, the user's next step is to make sure the refrigerator is ajar. So they need to open it. Then, pick up the milk from inside, then put it on the stove.

But the user hasn't interacted with the refrigerator yet. The current prompt says the refrigerator is closed. So the next action should be to open the refrigerator. Let me check the previous steps again. The user has gone through the bedroom steps, now in the kitchen. The next step is to open the fridge. Then check if the milk is there, then put it on the stove.

So the correct command here would be to open the refrigerator. The user needs to perform that action. The previous actions were all about the bedroom, now in the kitchen, so the next step is to open the fridge. Then proceed with the milk.
