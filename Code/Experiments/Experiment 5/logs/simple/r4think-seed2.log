You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, assure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is wide open. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. After unlocking the wooden door, assure that the wooden door is wide open. After that, head east. Then, ensure that the screen door in the kitchen is open. Then, make an attempt to move east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to head south. Then, pick-up the lettuce from the floor of the garden. Then, travel north. Then, try to take a trip west. Then, rest the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a chest drawer. What's that over there? It looks like it's an antique trunk. Were you looking for a king-size bed? Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You see a closed refrigerator. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What's the point of an empty counter? You can see a stove. The stove is usual. The stove appears to be empty. You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Hmmm... what else, what else?

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let me go through the steps again to make sure I'm on track. The user has already completed the tasks in the bedroom: opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east into the kitchen. The next steps according to the original task were to ensure the screen door in the kitchen is open, then try to move east, then south, pick up the lettuce in the garden, travel north, west, rest the lettuce on the stove, and finally stop.

In the kitchen, the user now sees a closed screen door leading east and an open wooden door west. The next step mentioned was to ensure the screen door is open. So the next action should be to open the screen door. But wait, the user's last action was going east, which led them to the kitchen. Wait, no—the user was in the bedroom, opened the door, went east into the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the screen door is closed. The next task is to check the screen door in the kitchen is open. So the correct next step is to open the screen door. But the user's last action was "go east", which led them into the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the screen door is closed. So the next action should be to open the screen door. But the user's current location is the kitchen. So the next command should be "open screen door". But the game's response after going east into the kitchen says that the screen door is closed. So the user needs to open it. Then, after that, the next step is to attempt to move east again. But the user's next action should be to open the screen door. However, the user's previous action was "go east", which brought them into the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the screen door is closed. So the next step is to open it. Therefore, the next command should be "open screen door".

What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Oh, great. Here's a bbq. The bbq appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well Look over there! a patio table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial task. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. They opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden. In the garden, they picked up the lettuce.

Now, the next step according to the original task was to travel north from the garden. The user has just completed the garden part, so the next action should be to go north. The task also mentioned after picking up the lettuce, travel north, then try to take a trip west, then rest the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen.

So, the current location is the garden. The next step is to go north, which would take them back to the kitchen. Then, after that, they need to go west, but first, they have to rest the lettuce on the stove. But according to the steps, after traveling north, they should try to go west. But before that, they need to rest the lettuce on the stove. Wait, the original task says: "Then, travel north. Then, try to take a trip west. Then, rest the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen."

Wait, the order is: after picking up the lettuce, travel north, then try to go west, then rest the lettuce on the stove. But when they are in the garden, after picking up the lettuce, they need to go north to the kitchen. Once in the kitchen, they can try to go west (which would be back to the bedroom?), but the task says to rest the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen. So after going north to the kitchen, they need to rest the lettuce there. But the user is currently in the garden, so the next step is to go north to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, they can rest the lettuce on the stove. But the user's last action was picking up the lettuce in the garden. So the next action should be to go north to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, they can rest the lettuce on the stove. But the user's next command should be "go north" from the garden.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to rest the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen. But in the current location, which is the garden, there's no stove mentioned. The previous steps had them go through the kitchen, but now they're back in the garden. So the problem is that the stove isn't here. The correct action would be to go back to the kitchen first. The user tried "rest lettuce on stove" but that's not possible here. So the next step should be to go north back to the kitchen where the stove is located. That makes sense. Let me check the previous steps again to confirm. Yes, the garden has an exit to the north, which is the backyard, but the kitchen was earlier. Wait, maybe after going south from the garden, they're back in the backyard, but the stove is in the kitchen. So the correct path is to go back to the kitchen via the north exit from the garden. Wait, the garden's north exit is to the backyard, but the kitchen is probably connected via the kitchen door. Hmm, maybe the user needs to go back through the kitchen. But in the current state, the user is in the garden. The stove is in the kitchen. So the correct action is to go north to the backyard, then find the way back to the kitchen. But the user is in the garden, so the next step should be to go north to the backyard, then maybe west through the screen door to the kitchen. But the user's last action was in the garden. So the next command should be "go north" to get back to the backyard, then "go west" through the screen door to the kitchen. But the user is stuck trying to rest the lettuce on the stove, which isn't possible here. So the correct next step is to go back to the kitchen. But how? The garden's north exit is to the backyard, then from there, go west to the kitchen. So the user needs to "go north" again to get back to the backyard, then "go west" to the kitchen. But the user is in the garden, so first "go north" to the backyard. Then, from the backyard, "go west" to the kitchen. But the user's current location is the garden, so the first step is "go north".

Okay, the user is stuck on the "rest lettuce on stove" command. The game keeps saying that's not a recognized verb. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to recall the previous steps. The user has already picked up the lettuce in the garden and is now trying to rest it on the stove in the kitchen. But the problem is that the current location is the garden, and the stove is in the kitchen. So maybe the user needs to move back to the kitchen first.

Wait, the user tried to go north from the garden, which leads back to the backyard, then south again to the garden. That's not helpful. The correct path would be to go back to the kitchen. Let me check the previous locations.

After the garden, the user was in the backyard, then went south to the garden again. The kitchen is probably accessible from the backyard via the screen door leading west. So the user needs to go west from the backyard to the kitchen, then rest the lettuce on the stove.

But the user is currently in the garden. To get to the kitchen, they need to go north to the backyard, then west through the screen door. Once in the kitchen, they can rest the lettuce on the stove. However, the user might not have the correct commands to navigate there yet.

Alternatively, maybe the stove is in the garden? No, the stove was in the kitchen. The user is in the garden, so they need to go back to the kitchen. The correct sequence would be: go north to backyard, then west to kitchen, then rest the lettuce on the stove.

But the user is trying to rest the lettuce on the stove without moving. Since the stove is in the kitchen, they need to be in the kitchen to do that. So the next step is to go back to the kitchen via the backyard's screen door. Then, once in the kitchen, use the correct command to rest the lettuce on the stove.

But the user is in the garden, so they need to go north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, rest the lettuce on the stove. The problem is that the user hasn't moved to the kitchen yet. So the next action should be to go north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. But the user is currently in the garden, so the first step is to go north to the backyard. Then, from there, go west to the kitchen. Once in the kitchen, they can rest the lettuce on the stove.

But the user's last action was trying to rest the lettuce on the stove in the garden, which isn't possible. So the correct next step is to go back to the kitchen. Therefore, the user should first go north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, rest the lettuce on the stove. So the next command should be "go north" to reach the backyard, then "go west" to the kitchen. But the user is in the garden, so the first step is "go north" to the backyard.

-= Backyard =-
You're now in the backyard. You begin looking for stuff.

You make out a set of chairs. The set of chairs is ordinary. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Oh, great. Here's a bbq. The bbq appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well Look over there! a patio table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

You've just shown up in a garden. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



There is an unblocked exit to the north.

There is a half of a bag of chips, a bell pepper and a shovel on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete a series of tasks in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden. In the garden, they picked up the lettuce and now need to rest it on the stove in the kitchen.

The problem is that the command "rest lettuce on stove" isn't recognized. The user has tried it multiple times, but the game doesn't understand it. So, I need to figure out the correct command to put the lettuce on the stove.

Looking at the previous actions, the user was in the garden, picked up the lettuce. Now they need to go back to the kitchen. The correct sequence would be to go north from the garden back to the backyard, then west through the screen door to the kitchen, and then place the lettuce on the stove.

But the user is stuck in the garden, trying to rest the lettuce. Since "rest lettuce on stove" isn't working, maybe the correct command is "put lettuce on stove" or "place lettuce on stove". Alternatively, maybe the stove is in the kitchen, so they need to go to the kitchen first.

Wait, in the garden, the user is in the garden. The kitchen is probably accessible via the backyard. So the user needs to go back to the kitchen. The correct steps would be: go north to backyard, then west through the screen door to the kitchen, then use the correct command to put the lettuce on the stove.

But the user is in the garden, so the next step is to go north to the backyard. Then west to the kitchen. Once in the kitchen, they can put the lettuce on the stove. So the next action should be "go north" to get back to the backyard, then "go west" to the kitchen, then "put lettuce on stove".

But the user is currently in the garden, so the immediate next action is "go north" to the backyard. Then from there, "go west" to the kitchen. Once in the kitchen, they can use the correct command to place the lettuce on the stove. The problem is that the user is trying to rest it in the garden, which isn't the right place. So the correct action is to go back to the kitchen first.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete a series of tasks in this text-based game. They've already done most of the steps up to picking up the lettuce in the garden. The next step was to rest the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen. But every time they try to use the command "rest lettuce on stove", the system says it's not a recognized verb.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is different. In text adventures, verbs often have specific forms. Instead of "rest", maybe they should use "put" or "place". Let me check the previous actions. The user picked up the lettuce, so they have it. The stove is in the kitchen, which they've been to before.

Wait, the user was in the garden, then went back to the backyard, then to the garden again. The stove is in the kitchen. So they need to go back to the kitchen. But how? The exits are north, south, east, west. Let me check the previous locations.

Earlier, after the garden, they went to the backyard, then back to the garden. The kitchen is probably connected via the west door in the backyard. Wait, in the backyard description, there's an open screen door leading west. So maybe they need to go west from the backyard to get back to the kitchen.

But the user is currently in the garden. So the path is garden -> backyard -> kitchen. But the user has been going back and forth between garden and backyard. Maybe they need to go west from the backyard to reach the kitchen again. Then, once in the kitchen, they can put the lettuce on the stove.

But the user's last action was "go north" again, which took them back to the backyard. So perhaps the next step is to go west from the backyard to get to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, use the correct verb to place the lettuce on the stove.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "put lettuce on stove" instead of "rest". Let me think. In many text games, "put" is the verb used for placing items. So maybe the user should try "put lettuce on stove" instead.

But the user has been using "rest" before, which isn't working. So the correct action is to go to the kitchen, then use "put" instead of "rest". So the next steps would be: go west from the backyard to the kitchen, then put the lettuce on the stove.

But the user is currently in the backyard. So the next command should be "go west" to reach the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, use "put lettuce on stove".

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You see a closed refrigerator. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What's the point of an empty counter? You can see a stove. The stove is usual. The stove appears to be empty. You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Hmmm... what else, what else?

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld, and their goal is to follow a series of steps to complete a task. So far, they've managed to open the chest drawer in the bedroom, pick up the old key, unlock and open the wooden door, go east to the kitchen, open the screen door, go east again to the backyard, then south to the garden where they picked up the lettuce. Now they're back in the kitchen, and the next step is to rest the lettuce on the stove.

But the user is trying to use the command "rest lettuce on stove", which the game doesn't recognize. The game's response says that's not a valid verb. So, maybe the correct command is different. In text adventures, commands are usually verbs like "put" or "place". So instead of "rest", they might need to use "put" or "place" the lettuce on the stove.

Looking back at the game's previous interactions, when the user picked up the lettuce, they used "pick up lettuce". So the pattern is using verbs like "pick up", "open", "go", etc. Therefore, the correct command here would likely be "put lettuce on stove" or "place lettuce on stove". The word "rest" isn't a standard verb in this context, so the game is rejecting it.

The user has been following the steps correctly up to this point, but they're stuck on the last part. The next action should be to use the correct verb to place the lettuce on the stove. Once that's done, they should complete the task and reach the goal.
