I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar. After opening the wooden door, go east. Then, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. And then, attempt to travel east. And then, try to travel south. With that done, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After stealing the milk, head north. And then, attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You think about smashing the king-size bed to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and tried to make it ajar. But the system didn't recognize "ajar" as a verb, so they tried "unlock" again, which worked but maybe wasn't the right action.

The user is now asking if they're on the right track and what their next move should be. The goal is to eventually get the milk from the garden, so they need to proceed through the door. The current step is to make sure the wooden door is ajar. Since "ajar" isn't a valid command, maybe the correct action is to open the door instead. But the door is already unlocked. Alternatively, maybe "push" or "open" is the correct verb here. The user tried "unlock" again, which might not be the right action. The system's response after "ajar" was that it's not a recognized verb, so they need to use the correct command. The next step after unlocking is to open the door, so the correct command would be "open wooden door". Then, after that, go east as instructed. So the next action should be to open the door.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps in the TextWorld game. They've reached the Garden area where there's a milk on the floor. The previous action was "take milk from floor", but the system responded that it can't see any such thing. So the user needs to figure out the correct way to take the milk.

Looking at the description of the Garden, it says: "There is a milk, a half of a bag of chips, a lettuce and a shovel on the floor." So the milk is present. The error might be in the command's phrasing. Instead of "take milk from floor", maybe the correct command is "take milk". Since the milk is on the floor, specifying "from floor" might not be necessary. The game might expect a simpler command like "take milk" without the location. Let me check the previous commands. The user tried "take milk from floor" and it didn't work. So the next step is to try just "take milk".

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Bathroom. They keep going north and south, which is causing them to repeat the same rooms. The original goal was to lift the milk from the garden, rest it on the stove, and complete the task. But the user has already taken the milk from the garden and is now wandering back and forth between rooms.

The current step after taking the milk was to head north, but that leads to the bathroom, then back to the kitchen. The user needs to find the stove in the kitchen to rest the milk on it. However, the stove is described as being empty. Maybe the user needs to check the kitchen island or the refrigerator for any clues. But according to the previous steps, the milk was taken from the garden, and the next step was to go north, which isn't helpful.

Wait, the user's last action was "go north" from the kitchen, leading to the bathroom, then back to the kitchen. The correct path after taking the milk should be to go back to the kitchen and then to the stove. But the user is stuck in a loop. The problem is that the user is not following the correct sequence. After taking the milk in the garden, they should go back to the kitchen, then to the stove, and rest the milk there. But the user is instead going north and south repeatedly. So the next action should be to go back to the kitchen and then to the stove. However, the user's last position was the bathroom, so they need to go south back to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, go north to the bathroom again? No, that's not right. Wait, the kitchen has an exit to the north (bathroom) and south (backyard). But the user needs to get to the stove in the kitchen. Since the stove is in the kitchen, maybe the user needs to check the kitchen again. But the user is stuck in a loop. The correct next step is to go south from the bathroom back to the kitchen, then go to the stove. But the user's last action was "go north" from the kitchen, which led to the bathroom. So the next step should be to go south from the bathroom back to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, go to the stove. But the stove is described as being empty. So the user needs to rest the milk on the stove. The correct command would be "rest milk on stove" or "put milk on stove". But the game might require the exact phrasing. The user has already taken the milk, so the next step is to go back to the kitchen and then rest the milk on the stove. Therefore, the next action should be to go south from the bathroom to the kitchen, then rest the milk on the stove.
