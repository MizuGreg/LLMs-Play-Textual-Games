Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to open the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. With the old key, insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. After that, ensure that the wooden door is open. Then, try to go east. After that, open the refrigerator. After that, recover the tomato plant from the refrigerator. If you can get your hands on the tomato plant, sit the tomato plant on the stove in the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An usual kind of place.

A closed chest drawer is in the room. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an antique trunk. Huh, weird. What's that over there? It looks like it's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and tried to go east. But the game said they need to open the wooden door first. Wait, they already unlocked it. Maybe "unlock" is different from "open"? In some games, you have to physically open the door after unlocking it. So maybe the next step is to open the door instead of just unlocking it. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user tried to go east but the game said the door needs to be opened. So even though they unlocked it, the door might still be locked. So the correct action would be to open the door. The command should be "open wooden door". That makes sense. So the next action is to open the door, then proceed east. Let me make sure there's no other step in between. After opening the door, they can go east. Then the next steps are opening the refrigerator, getting the tomato plant, putting it on the stove. So the immediate next step is to open the wooden door.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a refrigerator. You make out a counter. The counter is standard. The counter appears to be empty. You make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove! oh well. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.
