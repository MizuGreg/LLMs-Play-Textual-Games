Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, ensure that the chest drawer inside the bedroom is open. After that, take the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. After picking up the old key, unlock the wooden door. If you have unlocked the wooden door, doublecheck that the wooden door is opened. And then, head east. After that, attempt to travel south. Then, retrieve the apple from the couch within the living room. And then, take a trip north. After that, place the apple on the stove within the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a bedroom.

You can see a chest drawer. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You make out a closed antique trunk. You can make out a king-size bed. Now why would someone leave that there? The king-size bed is ordinary. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens, here in TextWorld!

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps correctly so far. They opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and now the next step is to check if the door is open. The instruction says to double-check that the wooden door is opened after unlocking it. So the next action should be to verify the door's status. But the user might need to explicitly check it. However, in TextWorld, sometimes you have to interact with objects to confirm their state. Wait, the previous action was unlocking the door, so maybe the door is now open. The next step in the original plan is to head east. But the user's current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door leads east. So after unlocking, they need to go through the door east. But the user's last action was unlocking the door, and the score is at 3/4. The next step according to the original instructions is to head east. So the next command should be "go east". But the user's question is whether they're close to the goal. Since they've unlocked the door, the next step is to go east, then travel south, etc. So the next action is "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. They started by opening the chest drawer in the bedroom, taking the old key, and unlocking the wooden door. But then they tried to go east without opening the door first, which didn't work. The game keeps提示 that they need to open the wooden door before proceeding east.

So, the user's current score is 3/7, which suggests they might be a bit stuck. They need to figure out the correct sequence of actions. The key here is that the wooden door is unlocked but maybe not open? Wait, the previous message said "unlock wooden door" and the response was "That's unlocked at the moment." So maybe unlocking is different from opening? Or maybe the door is locked but they've unlocked it, but it's still closed. The user needs to open it after unlocking.

Wait, the initial instruction was to "unlock the wooden door" and then "doublecheck that the wooden door is opened." So perhaps after unlocking, they need to open it. But in the game, maybe the action is to open it after unlocking. The user tried to go east before opening it, which was incorrect. So the next step should be to open the wooden door after unlocking it. But the user already tried to go east again, which didn't work. So the correct action now is to open the door. But the user might have already unlocked it, so maybe the next step is to open it. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user first opened the chest drawer, took the key, unlocked the door. Then tried to go east, but the game said they need to open the door first. So maybe the door is unlocked but not open. So the next action should be to open the door. But the user tried to go east again, which didn't work. So the correct next step is to open the door. But the user's last action was "go east" again, which failed. So the next action should be to open the door. However, the user might not have the correct command for that. The possible commands here are "open wooden door" or "open door". The game's previous responses might have specific commands. Let me check the previous messages.

In the initial steps, the user was told to "unlock the wooden door", and after that, the game said "That's unlocked at the moment." So maybe the door is unlocked but still closed. Therefore, the next step is to open the door. So the correct command here is "open wooden door". The user needs to do that before going east. So the next action should be "open wooden door".

You arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

You can see a closed refrigerator, which looks usual, in the room. You can see a counter. The counter is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out a stove. The stove is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you make out a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and then tried to go east. But the game kept saying they needed to open the door first. Then they tried unlocking it again, but it was already unlocked. Finally, they managed to open the door and went east, entering the kitchen.

Now, the current location is the kitchen. The user's next step should be to check if they have done all the required actions up to this point. Let me recap the original instructions:

1. Open the chest drawer in the bedroom.
2. Take the old key from the chest drawer.
3. Unlock the wooden door.
4. Check that the door is open.
5. Go east.
6. Travel south.
7. Retrieve the apple from the couch in the living room.
8. Take a trip north.
9. Place the apple on the stove in the kitchen.
10. Win.

So far, the user has done steps 1-3, then had some hiccups with the door, but eventually opened it and went east to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, they need to go south, but the game says the south entrance is unguarded. Wait, the kitchen has a screen door east, open door west, and unguarded north and south. The user's next action should be to go south from the kitchen. But the original plan was to go east first, then south. Wait, the user was in the kitchen, and the next step after entering the kitchen is to go south. But the user's current location is the kitchen. The original plan after going east (from bedroom) was to travel south. So maybe the user needs to go south from the kitchen. But the user is in the kitchen now. Let me check the current room description again.

In the kitchen, the user can go north, south, east, or west. The user's next action should be to go south, as per the original plan. But the user might have to check if they need to do anything else in the kitchen. However, the original steps mention placing the apple on the stove in the kitchen after retrieving it from the living room. Wait, the user hasn't retrieved the apple yet. The steps are:

After unlocking the door and going east (to kitchen?), then travel south to living room to get the apple, then go north to kitchen to place it. Wait, the original instructions say: after unlocking the door, go east, then attempt to travel south (so from east, south would be to living room?), then retrieve the apple from the couch in the living room, then take a trip north (back to kitchen?), then place the apple on the stove.

So the user is in the kitchen now. The next step should be to go south from the kitchen to the living room. But the user is in the kitchen, and the south entrance is unguarded. So the correct next action is to go south. However, the user might have to check if they have the apple. But according to the steps, they need to retrieve the apple from the living room after traveling south. So the user should go south from the kitchen to the living room, get the apple, then go north back to the kitchen to place it on the stove. Therefore, the next action is to go south.

-= Living Room =-
You are in a living room. An ordinary kind of place.

You can make out a couch. The couch is typical. On the couch you see an apple. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a low table. The low table is normal. On the low table you make out a remote, so there's that. You can see a tv. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a tv, go to TextWorld. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

Okay, let's see. The user has to follow a series of steps to win the game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, went east, opened the door again, then went south to the living room, took the apple from the couch, and then went north back to the kitchen.

The next step according to the original instructions was to place the apple on the stove in the kitchen. The user is now in the kitchen again after going north. The stove is mentioned as being standard but empty. So the next logical action would be to place the apple on the stove. The user needs to say "put apple on stove" to complete that step. Then, once that's done, they should win the game. Let me check if there are any other steps missed. The original plan was after taking the apple, go north, then place it on the stove. So yes, that's the next step.
