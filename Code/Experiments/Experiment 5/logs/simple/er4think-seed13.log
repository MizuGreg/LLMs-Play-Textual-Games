I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be great if you could ensure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is open. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer. And then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. And then, make an attempt to go east. And then, open the screen door. After opening the screen door, make an effort to go to the east. Then, take a trip south. And then, retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the bell pepper, head north. Then, travel west. After that, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in the bedroom in TextWorld. They've already opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and now they need to ensure the door is open. The previous attempt to "ensure wooden door is open" was rejected because it's not a valid verb.

So, the next step should be to open the door. Since the door was just unlocked, maybe it's already open. But the instruction says to "ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open." The correct action here would be to "open the wooden door." Let me check the previous steps again.

After unlocking the door, the user tried "ensure wooden door is open" which didn't work. The correct command should be "open wooden door." Let me confirm that. The user has to open the door, maybe it's locked again or needs to be opened manually. So the next action should be "open wooden door."

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You can see a patio table. Now why would someone leave that there? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Garden scene. The prompt says there's a half of a bag of chips, an apple, a bell pepper, and a shovel on the floor. The user tried to "take bell pepper from floor" but got a response that they can't see any such thing. Wait, but the description clearly mentions a bell pepper is there. Maybe the correct command is just "take bell pepper" without specifying the floor? Or maybe "take bell pepper from floor" is correct, but the game's parser isn't recognizing it. Alternatively, perhaps the bell pepper is already on the floor, so just taking it directly.

Wait, the user's previous action was "take bell pepper from floor", but the game said they can't see any such thing. But according to the scene description, the bell pepper is on the floor. Maybe the correct command is just "take bell pepper" without the "from floor" part. Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to "retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden." So the correct action should be "take bell pepper from floor" but maybe the game expects just "take bell pepper" since it's already on the floor. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to pick it up directly. But the game's response says they can't see it, which is confusing because the description says it's there. Maybe there's a typo or a parsing issue. But the user's next step should be to take the bell pepper. So the correct command is "take bell pepper".

<think>
Okay, let's recap the user's progress. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the door, opened it, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden where they picked up the bell pepper. Then they went north back to the backyard, west to the kitchen, and south again to the kitchen.

The original goal was to retrieve the bell pepper and rest it on the stove. The user has the bell pepper now. The next step should be to go back to the kitchen where the stove is. Since they're currently in the kitchen again, maybe they need to go north to the bathroom again? Wait, no. The stove is in the kitchen. Wait, in the kitchen description, the stove is mentioned as being there. So maybe they just need to go north from the kitchen to the bathroom, but that's not helpful. Wait, the user is in the kitchen again after going south from the bathroom. The stove is in the kitchen. So the user needs to go to the stove and put the bell pepper on it. But the current location is the kitchen. The stove is described as "ordinary" and "empty". So the user needs to go to the stove and put the bell pepper there. But how? The command would be "go to stove" or "go to the stove". Alternatively, maybe the stove is a noun, so "go to stove". But in the previous steps, the user hasn't interacted with the stove yet. So the next action should be to go to the stove and put the bell pepper on it. But the user is already in the kitchen. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is there. So the correct command is "go to stove" or "go to the stove". Then, once there, "put bell pepper on stove". But the user's last action was "go south" to the kitchen. So the next step is to go to the stove. But the game might require the exact command. Let me check the previous commands. The user has the bell pepper. So the next step is to go to the stove and put it there. So the command should be "go to stove" or "go to the stove". But in the game's context, maybe "go to stove" is the correct command. Alternatively, maybe the stove is already in the room, so the user can just "put bell pepper on stove". But the user needs to be at the stove to do that. So first, go to the stove. Then put the bell pepper on it. So the next action is "go to stove".
