Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to ensure that the chest drawer is open. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. Then, make it so that the wooden door is ajar. And then, attempt to go to the east. Then, open the screen door. And then, travel east. With that done, make an effort to travel south. And then, retrieve the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. Then, make an attempt to move north. With that accomplished, head west. With that done, place the half of a bag of chips on the stove. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You've seen better bedrooms, but at least this one seems pretty normal.

You see a chest drawer. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. A closed antique trunk is nearby. You can make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. They've already opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and tried to ajar it but that wasn't working. Now they tried to go east, but the game said they need to open the door first.

So the current state is that the wooden door is unlocked but maybe not open? The user tried "ajar wooden door" which isn't a valid command. The correct action here would be to open the door. Since the door is unlocked, the next step should be to open it. Then, after opening, they can go east.

The user is asking if they're on the right track. From the steps given, the original goal was to reach the garden and get the half bag of chips. So far, they've done the first part: opened the chest, got the key, unlocked the door. Now they need to open the door to proceed east. Once the door is open, they can go east, then open the screen door, etc.

So the next action should be to open the wooden door. The correct command would be "open wooden door". That should make the door ajar, allowing them to go east next.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Backyard now. The original goal was to retrieve the half bag of chips from the garden. So far, they've gone through the Bedroom, Kitchen, Bathroom, and now the Backyard. The Backyard has a patio table, chairs, and a bbq, but nothing seems to be on them. The user needs to find the half bag of chips on the floor of the garden.

The current location is the Backyard, and the next step mentioned in the original instructions was to "retrieve the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden." So the user needs to look around the Backyard for the chips. The patio table is mentioned as empty, but maybe the chips are on the floor near the patio table or somewhere else in the Backyard.

The user's last action was going east from the Kitchen, which led them to the Backyard. Now, they need to search the Backyard for the chips. The command should be to look around or check the floor. But in TextWorld, the possible commands are limited to actions like 'look', 'take', 'go', etc. Since the user is supposed to "retrieve the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden," the next step is to check the floor where they are. So the correct command would be 'look around' or 'look floor', but based on the game's previous commands, maybe 'look' is the verb. However, the user has to use the correct command format. Since the user is in the Backyard, they need to look for the chips on the floor. The previous steps showed that when they were in the Kitchen, they had to open doors, so here they might need to 'look' or 'check' the floor. But the exact command might be 'look floor' or just 'look'. However, in the game's context, the user might need to use 'look' to check the area. Alternatively, since the chips are on the floor, the command could be 'take half bag of chips' if they find it. But the user hasn't found it yet. So the next action should be to look around the Backyard to find the chips. The correct command would be 'look' or 'look around'. But the user has to use the exact command that the game accepts. Since the user previously used 'go east' and 'open screen door', maybe 'look' is the next step. However, the user's previous action was 'go east', so the next step is to look for the chips. Therefore, the next command should be 'look' to check the area. But the user needs to find the chips on the floor, so maybe 'look floor' or 'look around'. The game might require 'look' as the verb. So the next action is 'look'.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Backyard, and they need to find the half bag of chips on the floor. They've tried looking around and the floor, but nothing shows up. Maybe the chips are hidden somewhere not immediately visible. Alternatively, maybe they need to interact with an object to find it. In the Backyard, there's a patio table, chairs, a bbq, and a screen door. The user has already opened the screen door and is now in the Backyard. Perhaps the chips are on the patio table, but the user didn't check there. Wait, the description says the patio table is empty. Hmm. Maybe the user needs to check under the table or somewhere else. Alternatively, maybe they need to move to another part of the Backyard. The user could try going south, as the exit is unblocked. Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to go south from the Backyard. So maybe the chips are in the south direction. The next action should be to go south. Let me confirm the previous message: "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded." So the user can go south. Maybe the chips are in the south area. So the next command is 'go south'.

Okay, let's see. The user has completed most of the tasks. They found the half bag of chips in the garden and took it. Now they're back in the Backyard. The original goal was to retrieve the chips and then do some other actions. But the user has already achieved the main goal of getting the chips. The next steps mentioned in the original instructions were to "make an effort to travel south. And then, retrieve the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. Then, make an attempt to move north. With that accomplished, head west. With that done, place the half of a bag of chips on the stove."

Wait, the user already took the chips from the garden. Now they're in the Backyard again. The next step after taking the chips was to move north, which they did, leading them back to the Backyard. Now, the next action should be to head west, as per the original instructions. So the correct command is "go west" to move towards the stove, which is in the Kitchen. But the user is in the Backyard now. The Backyard has an open screen door leading west, which connects back to the Kitchen. So the next step is to go west, then proceed to the Kitchen where the stove is. The user needs to place the chips on the stove. So the next action is "go west" to reach the Kitchen and then interact with the stove.
