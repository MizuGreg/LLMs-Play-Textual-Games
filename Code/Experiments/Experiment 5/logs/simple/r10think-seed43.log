You are now playing a fast paced episode of TextWorld! First, it would be fantastic if you could make absolutely sure that the chest drawer is ajar. Then, take the old key from the chest drawer. After that, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door within the bedroom is opened. And then, make an attempt to head east. If you can get around to doing that, look and see that the refrigerator within the kitchen is open. Once you have opened the refrigerator, pick up the milk from the refrigerator inside the kitchen. If you can get your hands on the milk, place the milk on the stove inside the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal kind of place.

You see a closed chest drawer. You can make out a closed antique trunk right there by you. You can see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.

You make out a closed refrigerator. You see a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You can see a stove. The stove is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You move on, clearly angry about TextWorld. You can see a kitchen island. You wonder idly who left that here. You see a note on the kitchen island. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps in the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. Now they're in the kitchen, opened the refrigerator, and found milk and lettuce.

The original goal was to pick up the milk, put it on the stove, and then win. So far, they've opened the fridge and found the milk. The next logical step is to take the milk from the refrigerator. Then, they need to go to the stove and put it there. 

Looking at the current location, the kitchen has a stove, a counter, a kitchen island, and exits in all directions. The user has already opened the fridge, so the next action should be to take the milk. After that, they need to go to the stove. The stove is mentioned as being usual but empty. So after taking the milk, they should go to the stove and put it there. 

The user's last action was opening the refrigerator, and the next step is to take the milk. Then, move to the stove. The response should be "take milk from refrigerator" first. But wait, in the game's context, maybe the milk is already in the fridge, so taking it would be the next step. Then, go to the stove. So the next command should be "take milk from refrigerator".
