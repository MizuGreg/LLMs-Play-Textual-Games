Welcome to TextWorld! First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After pulling open the antique trunk, recover the old key from the antique trunk within the bedroom. Then, insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. And then, ensure that the wooden door is open. And then, make an effort to head east. After that, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. After that, go to the east. And then, make an attempt to take a trip south. Following that, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. If you have picked up the milk, venture north. And then, go west. And then, sit the milk on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. The room is well lit.

You can make out a chest drawer. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an antique trunk. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the game, repeatedly trying to unlock the wooden door but it's not opening. They've already taken the old key from the trunk and used it to unlock the door, but the door is still closed. The game's prompt says they need to make sure the wooden door is open before going east.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the door is locked but not properly opened. The user tried unlocking it with the key, but maybe the door isn't fully open. Let me check the previous steps again. The user inserted the key into the lock and unlocked it, but the door might still be closed. The game's message says "That's unlocked at the moment," so maybe the door is unlocked but not open. So the next step should be to open the door after unlocking it. But the user hasn't tried opening it yet. So the correct action would be to open the wooden door after it's unlocked. But the user is getting confused between unlocking and opening. The game's instructions say to "ensure that the wooden door is open" after inserting the key. So maybe the user needs to open the door instead of just unlocking it. But the previous action was "unlock wooden door," which might not be the right command. The correct command might be "open wooden door" instead of "unlock." But the user has been using "unlock" and the game is responding that it's already unlocked. So perhaps the user needs to try opening the door after it's unlocked. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked and needs to be opened with the key, but the game is confused between unlocking and opening. The user's next action should be to open the door, not just unlock it. But the game's previous response says that the door is already unlocked. So maybe the user needs to proceed to go east even if it's unlocked. But the game's message says "You have to open the wooden door first," which is conflicting. Maybe the game is using "unlock" and "open" as separate steps. The user might need to first unlock the door and then open it. But the user already unlocked it, so the next step is to open it. However, the game's response says "That's unlocked at the moment," so maybe the door is unlocked but not open. Therefore, the correct action is to open the door. But the user's previous action was "unlock wooden door," which might not be the right command. The correct command might be "open wooden door." So the user should try "open wooden door" instead of "unlock." But the user has been using "unlock" and the game is not accepting it. Therefore, the user needs to try "open wooden door" to proceed. But the game's prompt says "You have to open the wooden door first," so the user needs to open it. So the next action should be "open wooden door."

-= Kitchen =-
You have walked into the most ordinary of all possible kitchens. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You see a refrigerator. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a counter. The counter appears to be empty. Look over there! a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Classic TextWorld.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen scene. They need to check if the screen door is open. But every time they try to command "check screen door is open," the system responds that it only understood "check screen door." So maybe the correct verb is just "check screen door" without the "is open" part. The user has been repeatedly trying to add "is open" which isn't necessary. The previous attempt to "doublecheck screen door is open" was incorrect. The correct action is likely "check screen door" or "check the screen door." Since the system didn't accept "doublecheck," maybe "check screen door" is the right command. The user needs to try that again without the extra words.

You find yourself in a backyard. A normal kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a set of chairs. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a set of chairs in a room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a bbq. The bbq is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You make out a patio table. The patio table is ordinary. The patio table appears to be empty.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the instructions in the TextWorld game. They've completed several steps: opening the trunk, getting the key, unlocking the door, going east to the kitchen, checking the screen door, opening it, then going east again to the backyard, and finally reaching the garden. Now, in the garden, they need to pick up the milk from the floor. The user has tried "lift milk from floor of garden" but the system didn't recognize it. Then they tried "pick up milk from floor", which was partially understood.

The user is now asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. The next step according to the original instructions was to pick up the milk, then go north, then west, then put the milk on the stove. So far, they've picked up the milk, but the system is having trouble recognizing the command. The user might be stuck here because the command isn't being accepted. The correct command should be "pick up milk" or "take milk". Since the system previously accepted "pick up milk from floor", maybe the user needs to try that again. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is just "pick up milk" without specifying the floor. But the original instruction said "lift the milk from the floor of the garden", so maybe the exact phrasing is needed. However, the system's response indicates that "pick up milk from floor" is not recognized, so perhaps the correct command is "pick up milk". The user has tried "pick up milk from floor" multiple times, but the system is not accepting it. The next step would be to try a different phrasing, like "take milk" or "pick up milk". Since the user is instructed to only output the command, the correct action here is to try "pick up milk" again, even though the system might not recognize it. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "get milk". But based on the previous interactions, the user should try "pick up milk" again.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a loop between the Kitchen and Bathroom, going back and forth. The original goal was to pick up the milk and then go west and sit it on the stove. But they've been stuck in a cycle of moving between rooms without progressing towards the final steps.

First, I need to check where the milk is. The user picked up the milk in the Garden, then went back to the Kitchen. Now, they need to go west from the Kitchen to the Bathroom, but that's not helpful. Wait, the original plan was after picking up the milk, venture north, then go west, then sit the milk on the stove. But in the current state, they're in the Kitchen again. Maybe the stove is in the Kitchen. The user has the milk, so they need to go to the stove, which is in the Kitchen. But they've been moving around without focusing on that.

The user's last action was going south from the Bathroom back to the Kitchen. Now, they need to go to the stove in the Kitchen, put the milk there. But the current description of the Kitchen mentions a stove but says there's nothing on it. So the next step should be to go to the stove and put the milk down. However, the user hasn't done that yet. They need to go to the stove, which is in the Kitchen, and then put the milk there. The command would be to go to the stove, but in the game's context, maybe the correct command is to "put milk on stove" or something similar. But the user has to first navigate to the stove's location. Since they're already in the Kitchen, they can directly interact with the stove. So the next action should be to put the milk on the stove.
