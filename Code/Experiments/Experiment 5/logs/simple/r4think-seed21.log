You are now playing a profound game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to open the antique trunk in the bedroom. After that, pick up the old key from the antique trunk. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. And then, open the wooden door inside the bedroom. And then, attempt to go east. Following that, go to the south. Then, recover the apple from the couch in the living room. After that, try to venture north. After that, put the apple on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in a bedroom.

You see a closed chest drawer. You see a closed antique trunk in the room. You can see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can make out a refrigerator. You see a counter. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove! The stove is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a kitchen island. You shudder, but continue examining the kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can make out a note. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the task. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen, south to the living room. Now they're in the living room, and the next step according to the original task was to recover the apple from the couch in the living room. The user has already done that, as the apple is on the couch. Then they need to try to venture north from the living room.

Wait, the current location is the living room. The task says after recovering the apple, try to go north. Then put the apple on the stove. But the user is in the living room now. The next action should be to go north. But the living room's description mentions that the north exit is unblocked. So the user should go north. But the user's last action was going south to the living room. Wait, no: the user was in the kitchen, went south to the living room. Now, in the living room, the next step is to go north. But the task says after recovering the apple, try to go north. So the user needs to go north from the living room. Then, after that, put the apple on the stove.

But the user's current location is the living room. The next step is to go north. So the correct command is "go north". Then, once in the next room (probably the kitchen again?), they need to put the apple on the stove. But the stove is in the kitchen. So after going north, they would be in the kitchen, then put the apple on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is "go north".

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Living Room, going back and forth. The original goal was to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock and open the door, then go east, south, get the apple, go north, put the apple on the stove. But the user has already done most of those steps except for putting the apple on the stove.

Wait, in the current state, the user is in the Living Room, which they've been going back and forth between. The apple is on the couch. The next step after getting the apple was to go north and put it on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the current location is the Living Room, and the stove is in the Kitchen. So the user needs to go from the Living Room to the Kitchen (north), then find the stove and put the apple there.

But in the previous steps, the user tried going north from the Living Room, which led them back to the Kitchen. However, the stove is in the Kitchen, so once in the Kitchen, they need to interact with the stove. But in the Kitchen description, the stove is ordinary and has nothing on it. The user needs to put the apple on the stove. So the correct sequence is: go north from Living Room to Kitchen, then put the apple on the stove.

But the user hasn't picked up the apple yet. Wait, the user was supposed to recover the apple from the couch in the Living Room. So first, they need to pick up the apple from the couch. But in the current state, the user is in the Living Room, and the apple is on the couch. So the next action should be to pick up the apple, then go north to the Kitchen, then put it on the stove.

But in the previous steps, the user hasn't picked up the apple. The user's last action was going north from the Living Room to the Kitchen, but they didn't pick up the apple. So the correct next step is to pick up the apple from the couch in the Living Room. Then go north to the Kitchen and put it on the stove.

But the user is currently in the Living Room, so the next action should be to pick up the apple. However, the user's last action was going north, which led them to the Kitchen. But the user hasn't picked up the apple yet. So the next step is to pick up the apple from the couch. Then go north to the Kitchen and put it on the stove.

But the user's current location is the Living Room, so the next action should be to pick up the apple. The user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next command is "take apple from couch" or something similar. However, the user's previous actions were going back and forth, so maybe they missed picking up the apple.

Wait, looking back at the history: After getting the apple from the couch, the user was supposed to go north and put it on the stove. But in the current state, the user is in the Living Room, and the apple is on the couch. So the user needs to pick up the apple first. Then go north to the Kitchen and put it on the stove.

But in the current prompt, the user is in the Living Room, and the apple is on the couch. So the next action should be to pick up the apple. However, the user hasn't done that yet. The user's last action was going north, which led them to the Kitchen, but they didn't pick up the apple. So the correct next step is to pick up the apple from the couch in the Living Room.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to put the apple on the stove, but the game says they can't see any such thing. Hmm. Earlier, they took the apple from the couch in the living room. Now they're in the living room again, right? The stove is in the kitchen, so maybe they need to go back to the kitchen.

Wait, the user just tried to put the apple on the stove, but the stove isn't here in the living room. The stove is in the kitchen. So the next step should be to go to the kitchen. Let me check the previous moves. The user was in the living room, tried to go north again, which took them back to the kitchen. But they haven't gone south yet. Maybe they need to go back to the kitchen through the west door. So the correct action would be to go west to the kitchen, then put the apple on the stove. But the user is still in the living room, so the next command should be to go west. But the user is trying to put the apple on the stove directly. So the mistake is that they're in the living room, not the kitchen. Therefore, the correct action is to go west to the kitchen first. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to go west to the kitchen, then put the apple on the stove. But the user is currently in the living room, so the next command should be "go west" to reach the kitchen where the stove is. Then, once in the kitchen, they can put the apple on the stove. So the answer should be "go west".

You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can make out a refrigerator. You see a counter. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove! The stove is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a kitchen island. You shudder, but continue examining the kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can make out a note. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

You are in a living room. An ordinary kind of place.

You can see a couch. The couch is standard. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. This always happens! You smell a great smell, and follow it to a low table. On the low table you see a remote. You can make out a tv. The tv is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete a task. The goal seems to be to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock and open the wooden door, then move east, south, retrieve the apple from the couch, and put it on the stove.

Looking at the current state, the user has already completed the first part: they've opened the trunk, picked up the key, unlocked and opened the door, and moved east to the kitchen. Then they went south to the living room, picked up the apple from the couch. But now they're trying to put the apple on the stove. The problem is that in the living room description, there's a low table with a remote and a TV, but no stove mentioned. The stove is in the kitchen, but when they tried to go west from the living room, it was blocked. They tried going south and north again, but the stove isn't visible in the living room.

So the user is stuck because they can't find the stove in the living room. The key here is that the stove is in the kitchen, but they might not be able to access it from the living room. The previous attempts to go west from the living room were blocked, so maybe they need to go back to the kitchen and then find the stove there. However, in the kitchen, the stove is mentioned, but there's nothing on it. The user tried to put the apple on the stove from the living room, which isn't possible because the stove is in the kitchen. Therefore, the correct action would be to go back to the kitchen, then try to put the apple on the stove there. But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next step should be to go back to the kitchen and then attempt to put the apple on the stove.

Well, here we are in a bedroom.

You see a closed chest drawer. You see an opened antique trunk in the room. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!

There is an open wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete a series of tasks in this TextWorld game. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, picked up the key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen, south to the living room, and so on. The main goal was to eventually put the apple on the stove.

But in the living room, after taking the apple from the couch, the user tried to put it on the stove. However, the stove wasn't visible in the living room description. The user kept trying "put apple on stove" but got errors because the stove was in the kitchen, not the living room. Then they wandered around between rooms, eventually returning to the kitchen again.

Now, the user is in the kitchen again, and the task is to put the apple on the stove. But the apple is in the living room. Wait, no—the user took the apple from the couch in the living room and is now in the kitchen. But the stove is in the kitchen. So the apple is in the user's inventory, right? Wait, the last action was taking the apple from the couch in the living room, which was successful. Then the user tried to put it on the stove, but the stove wasn't in the living room. So the user must be in the kitchen now, and the stove is there. But the user is in the kitchen, and the apple is in their inventory. So the correct action would be to put the apple on the stove in the kitchen.

But the user tried "put apple on stove" multiple times and got errors. Maybe the command should be "put apple on stove" when in the kitchen. But the error says "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the stove isn't described as being there, or the apple isn't in the right place. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is mentioned in the kitchen description. So the user should be able to put the apple on the stove now. But the previous attempts failed. Maybe the user needs to first pick up the apple from the couch, then go to the kitchen, then put it on the stove. But the user already did that. Wait, the user took the apple from the couch in the living room, then went to the kitchen, but the stove wasn't in the living room. So the user is in the kitchen now, and the apple is in their inventory. So the correct command is "put apple on stove".

But the system keeps saying "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the stove isn't in the current room. Wait, the kitchen description says: "You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove! The stove is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it." So the stove is present. Therefore, the user should be able to put the apple on it. Maybe the error is a glitch, but the user needs to try again. So the next action should be "put apple on stove".
