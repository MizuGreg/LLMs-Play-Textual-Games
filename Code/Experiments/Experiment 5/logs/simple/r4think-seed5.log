You are now playing a life changing session of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to assure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is open. Then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer in the bedroom. After that, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door in the bedroom is open. After that, make an attempt to move east. Following that, open the refrigerator. And then, pick up the apple from the refrigerator. After that, rest the apple on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal one. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a chest drawer. You can make out an antique trunk. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. Their goal is to open the chest drawer, get the old key, unlock the wooden door, open it, move east, open the fridge, pick up an apple, put it on the stove, and win.

So far, they've opened the chest drawer, retrieved the key, unlocked the door, and the door is now open. The next step according to the instructions was to ensure the wooden door is open. Since they just unlocked it, maybe they need to open it fully. But in text adventures, sometimes "unlock" and "open" are different actions. Wait, the user's last action was "unlock wooden door with old key", which worked. Now the door is unlocked, but maybe it's still closed. So the next step would be to open the door. The user's next command should be "open wooden door".

But the user's current prompt says "Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?" So they're asking for confirmation and the next action. The user's previous steps have been correct: open chest, take key, unlock door. Now, after unlocking, the door might be closed but unlocked. So the next step is to open it. Then move east. Then proceed to the next steps.

So the next action should be "open wooden door". Then after that, "go east", then open the fridge, etc. The user needs to follow each step carefully. The assistant's job is to output the next command based on the current state. Since the door is unlocked but maybe not open, the correct next step is to open it. So the answer should be "open wooden door".

-= Kitchen =-
Ah, the kitchen. This is some kind of kitchen, really great standard vibes in this place, a wonderful standard atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a refrigerator. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You see a stove. The stove is usual. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game. They started by opening the chest drawer in the bedroom, retrieving the old key, unlocking the wooden door, and opening it. Then they moved east to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, they opened the refrigerator and found a milk and an apple.

The next step according to the original task was to pick up the apple from the refrigerator. So the user should take the apple. After that, they need to rest the apple on the stove. So after taking the apple, the next action would be to go to the stove and put the apple there. But the user's last action was opening the refrigerator, so the immediate next step is to take the apple. The user's response should be "take apple from refrigerator" but the system might have a specific verb. Wait, in the game's context, the correct command would be "take apple" or "pick up apple". But looking at previous interactions, the user used "take old key from chest drawer", so maybe the correct command here is "take apple from refrigerator". However, the game might accept "take apple" if it's in the refrigerator. But the user's previous action was "open refrigerator", so the next step is to take the apple from there. The user's next command should be "take apple from refrigerator". But the system might have a specific way. Let me check the previous steps. The user said "retrieve old key from chest drawer" which was corrected to "take old key from chest drawer". So in this case, the correct command would be "take apple from refrigerator". However, the user might just say "take apple" if the game allows that. But the system's previous response after opening the refrigerator was "You open the refrigerator, revealing a milk and an apple." So the next step is to take the apple. The user's next action should be "take apple from refrigerator". But the user's last input was "open refrigerator", so the assistant's response should be "take apple from refrigerator". However, the user's next action in the game might be to take the apple, then go to the stove and put it there. So the next command is "take apple from refrigerator".
