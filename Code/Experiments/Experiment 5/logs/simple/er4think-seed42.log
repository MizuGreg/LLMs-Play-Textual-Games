I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First stop, open the chest drawer. After that, recover the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. And then, open the wooden door inside the bedroom. Then, go to the east. And then, look and see that the screen door in the kitchen is ajar. After that, make an effort to venture east. And then, attempt to move south. With that accomplished, lift the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. After that, move north. Okay, and then, attempt to take a trip west. Following that, rest the bell pepper on the stove. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
You've fallen into an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the bedroom.

You can see a closed chest drawer. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an antique trunk. Hmm. You always thought you'd be more excited to see an antique trunk in a room. You can make out a king-size bed. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and tried to go east but were told they need to open the door first. The door is already unlocked, but maybe they need to open it fully?

Wait, the previous action was trying to go east, and the game said the door has to be opened first. But the user just unlocked it, so maybe the door is locked but not yet open. The message said "That's unlocked at the moment," which might mean the key is in the lock, but the door isn't fully open. So maybe the next step is to open the door instead of just unlocking it?

The user's next action should be to open the wooden door. Let me check the previous steps again. They had the old key, unlocked the door, but maybe the door is still closed. So the correct action is to open the door. The game might require using the key to open it, but since it's already unlocked, perhaps just opening it is the next step. So the next command should be "open the wooden door".

You are in a kitchen. A standard kind of place. Let's see what's in here.

You make out a closed refrigerator nearby. You can see a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is normal. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

You make out a set of chairs. The set of chairs is usual. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make out a bbq. The bbq is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You see a patio table. The patio table is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let me figure out the next step here. The user has been progressing through the game, following the instructions given. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, retrieved the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door to go east into the kitchen, then opened the screen door to go east again into the backyard. Now, in the backyard, they need to proceed further.

The current location is the backyard. The possible directions mentioned are west (screen door) and south (unguarded exit). The user's next action should be to go south since the screen door is already open but maybe they need to check the south direction as per the game's instructions. The previous steps indicate that after the kitchen, they went east to the backyard, and now they should try moving south. The game's goal involves moving through different areas, so going south from the backyard makes sense. The user's next command should be "go south".

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in the Garden scene trying to take the bell pepper. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "lift the bell pepper from the floor of the garden" but got an error. Then they tried "take the bell pepper from the floor of the garden" again and again, but each time it says "You can't see any such thing." Then they tried "look around" but that also didn't work.

Wait, the game's description of the Garden says: "There is a lettuce, a bell pepper, an apple and a shovel on the floor." So the bell pepper is indeed there. But the user is getting an error when trying to take it. Maybe the correct command is just "take bell pepper" without specifying the floor? Or maybe "take the bell pepper" without the "from the floor" part? Because the error says "You can't see any such thing," which might mean that the command is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the game expects a different verb. The user tried "lift" but it wasn't recognized. The correct verb might be "take" instead of "lift". Let me check the previous correct commands. The user was told to "lift the bell pepper from the floor of the garden" but that wasn't recognized. Then they tried "take the bell pepper from the floor of the garden" which also failed. But according to the game's description, the bell pepper is on the floor, so maybe the correct command is just "take bell pepper" or "take the bell pepper".

Wait, in the game's description, the user is told to "lift the bell pepper from the floor of the garden". But the system says that's not a recognized verb. So maybe the correct verb is "take" instead of "lift". So the correct command should be "take the bell pepper from the floor of the garden" but the system is not recognizing it. Alternatively, maybe the game expects "take bell pepper" without the "from the floor of the garden" part. But the user has to follow the instructions given in the initial problem statement.

The initial instructions said: "lift the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. After that, move north. Okay, and then, attempt to take a trip west. Following that, rest the bell pepper on the stove. And once you've done that, you win!"

So according to the initial instructions, the user needs to lift the bell pepper. But the game's system is not recognizing "lift" as a verb. Maybe the correct verb is "take" instead. So the user should try "take the bell pepper from the floor of the garden" again. But the system keeps saying "You can't see any such thing." That's confusing because the game's description says the bell pepper is there.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to "look around" to see the bell pepper, but they tried that and it didn't work. Wait, the user tried "look around" and got "You can't see any such thing." But according to the game's description, the bell pepper is on the floor. So maybe the game is not updating the inventory correctly, or there's a typo in the command.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is just "take bell pepper" without the "from the floor of the garden" part. Let me check the game's possible commands. In TextWorld, the correct command would be "take bell pepper" if it's in the room. But the user is getting an error, so maybe the game expects "take the bell pepper" with the article. But the system says "You can't see any such thing," which suggests that the bell pepper isn't visible. But according to the game's description, it is there.

This is a bit confusing. The user needs to take the bell pepper, but the system isn't recognizing it. Maybe the correct action is to just "take bell pepper" without the "from the floor of the garden" part. Let me try that. The user's next action should be "take bell pepper".

Okay, the user is trying to rest the bell pepper on the stove, but the game isn't recognizing "rest" as a verb. Let me check the previous steps. The user picked up the bell pepper and is now in the garden. The game's description mentions a stove in the kitchen, but the current location is the garden. Wait, maybe the stove is in the kitchen, which is west of the backyard. But the user is in the garden now. Hmm, maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen to rest the bell pepper there. But the instruction said to rest it on the stove after moving north. Wait, the user was in the garden, then moved north to the backyard, then south back to the garden. The stove is in the kitchen, which is west of the backyard. So the user needs to go west from the backyard to the kitchen, then rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the current location is the garden. Maybe the user needs to go west to the kitchen first. But the user's last action was moving south, which brought them back to the garden. So the next step should be to go west to the kitchen, then rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is trying to rest it in the garden, which might not have a stove. The game's description of the garden mentions a lettuce, apple, and shovel, but not a stove. So the correct place is the kitchen. Therefore, the user needs to go west to the kitchen, then rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is in the garden, so the next command should be "go west" to reach the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, "rest the bell pepper on the stove". But the user is currently in the garden, so the next action is "go west" to the kitchen. However, the user's last action was "go south" to the garden. The current location is the garden, so the user needs to go west to the kitchen. But the game's current scene is the garden, so the correct next step is to go west. But the user is trying to rest the bell pepper here, which isn't possible. Therefore, the user needs to go west to the kitchen first. So the next command should be "go west".

Okay, the user is stuck in the Garden scene trying to go west. The game says "You can't go that way." Let me check the previous locations. The user was in the Garden, then moved south to the Backyard, then north back to the Garden. The Garden's description mentions a screen door leading west, but when trying to go west, it's blocked. Wait, maybe the user needs to go south again to the Backyard and then west from there? But the user is in the Garden. Let me check the Garden's description again. The Garden says: "You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked." So the Garden has a north exit. The Backyard has a west exit. So maybe the user needs to go north to the Backyard again, then west to the Kitchen. But the user is in the Garden, so the next step should be to go north to the Backyard, then west to the Kitchen. But the user is trying to go west from the Garden, which is blocked. So the correct sequence is: from Garden, go north to Backyard, then go west to Kitchen. But the user is currently in the Garden. So the next command should be "go north" to reach the Backyard, then "go west" to the Kitchen. However, the user is trying to go west directly from the Garden, which isn't possible. Therefore, the correct next action is to go north to the Backyard first.

-= Backyard =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so typical all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the backyard. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You make out a set of chairs. The set of chairs is usual. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make out a bbq. The bbq is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You see a patio table. The patio table is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

You are in a kitchen. A standard kind of place. Let's see what's in here.

You make out a closed refrigerator nearby. You can see a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is normal. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, the user is trying to rest the bell pepper on the stove in the Kitchen, but the game isn't recognizing "rest" as a verb. Let me think about the possible commands. In TextWorld, the correct verb for placing an item on a surface is usually "put". The user might have used "rest" instead of "put". So the correct command should be "put the bell pepper on the stove". Let me check the previous steps. The user had the bell pepper in their inventory after picking it up in the Garden. Now, in the Kitchen, they need to put it on the stove. The game's response indicates that "rest" isn't a valid verb here. Therefore, the next action should be "put the bell pepper on the stove".
