It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to make absolutely sure that the antique trunk is opened. And then, take the old key from the antique trunk within the bedroom. After that, check that the wooden door within the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. After that, look and see that the wooden door is open. After that, try to move east. After that, open the screen door in the kitchen. And then, venture east. Then, attempt to travel south. And then, lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden. If you have picked up the lettuce, travel north. And then, try to move west. Then, rest the lettuce on the stove. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
I am excited to announce that you are now in the bedroom. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a chest drawer. Hmm. You always thought you'd be more excited to see a chest drawer in a room. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to an antique trunk. You can make out a king-size bed. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps in the TextWorld game. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door. Now they're in the next room, which I assume is the kitchen since the next step mentioned was opening the screen door in the kitchen.

The user's next action should be to open the screen door in the kitchen. The previous steps were all in the bedroom, so moving east would take them to the kitchen. But the current prompt says "venture east" after opening the screen door. Wait, the original task said after opening the screen door in the kitchen, venture east. So first, they need to open the screen door, then go east. Then travel south, pick up lettuce, etc.

But the user's last action was opening the wooden door, which led them to the next room. The next step in the original task was to "open the screen door in the kitchen." So the current location is the kitchen. Therefore, the next command should be "open screen door." Then, after that, they need to venture east. But the user's next move after opening the screen door would be to go east. But according to the original instructions, after opening the screen door, they should venture east. So the next action is to open the screen door. Then, after that, go east. Then travel south, etc.

So the correct next action here is to open the screen door in the kitchen. The user is in the kitchen now, so the command should be "open screen door."

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in the bedroom, and they've already completed the steps up to unlocking and opening the wooden door. The next step in the original task was to "venture east" after opening the screen door in the kitchen. But when they tried to venture east, the game didn't recognize it as a valid command.

Wait, maybe the user is still in the bedroom. The previous action was opening the wooden door, which led them to the next room. But the game's response says "That's not a verb I recognise," so maybe the user is still in the bedroom and trying to move east again. But the wooden door was already opened, so perhaps they need to check if they're in the correct room.

Alternatively, maybe the screen door in the kitchen isn't in the bedroom. The user might have confused the rooms. The original task said after opening the wooden door (in the bedroom), they should "venture east" to the kitchen. But if the screen door is in the kitchen, then the user needs to be in the kitchen to open it. So perhaps the user is still in the bedroom and needs to go east to the kitchen first.

But the user tried "venture east" and it wasn't recognized. Maybe the correct command is "go east" instead of "venture east." The game might be using "go" as the verb for movement. So the user should try "go east" instead. Let me check the previous commands. The user had "open wooden door," which worked. So maybe "go east" is the correct command now. The user might have used "venture" instead of "go," which is why it wasn't recognized. So the next action should be "go east."

You've just sauntered into a kitchen. Let's see what's in here.

Were you looking for a refrigerator? Because look over there, it's a refrigerator. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is usual. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Hm. Oh well You make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can make out a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user has opened the screen door in the kitchen, which was the next step after venturing east. Now, according to the original task, after opening the screen door in the kitchen, they need to "venture east." So the next action should be to go east from the kitchen. The screen door was leading east, so opening it would allow movement into the next room. The user is in the kitchen now, and the screen door is open. The next step is to move east, which would take them to the next area, probably the garden or another part of the house. The original goal involves moving east again after that. So the correct command here is "go east."

Now why would someone leave that there? The bbq is typical. But there isn't a thing on it. You scan the room for a patio table, and you find a patio table. You shudder, but continue examining the patio table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's recap. The user's goal is to pick up the lettuce, then travel north, then west, and rest the lettuce on the stove. They've already picked up the lettuce in the garden. The next step was to go north, which they did, but when they tried to go south again, it wasn't recognized. Now they're back in the garden.

Wait, after picking up the lettuce, the original instructions said to "travel north" and then "try to move west". So after going north, they should be in the backyard again. Then, from there, move west. But the user tried to go south from the backyard and it didn't work. Now they're in the garden again. Maybe they need to go west from the garden? But the garden's exit is north. Hmm.

Wait, the current location is the garden. The exit to the north is unguarded. The user needs to move west. But the garden's description says there's an exit to the north, and other items on the floor. Maybe the user is supposed to go west from the garden, but the garden doesn't have a west exit. Wait, the backyard has a screen door leading west. So perhaps after going north from the garden, they're back in the backyard, then can go west. But the user is in the garden again. Maybe they need to go north again to get back to the backyard, then west. But the user's last action was going south, which didn't work. So maybe the correct next step is to go north again to reach the backyard, then west. But the user is in the garden, so the next command should be "go north" to get back to the backyard. Then from there, "go west" to reach the next area. But the user's last command was "go south" which didn't work, so they're stuck in the garden. Therefore, the next action should be "go north" again to proceed to the backyard, then west. But according to the current prompt, they're in the garden, so the next step is to go north. But the user has already done that. Wait, the user's last action was "go south" which didn't work, so they're back in the garden. So the correct next action is "go north" again to get to the backyard, then from there, "go west". But the user needs to rest the lettuce on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen. So maybe after going west from the backyard, they reach the kitchen, then the stove is there. But the user has the lettuce, so they need to go back to the kitchen. So the steps are: garden -> north -> backyard -> west -> kitchen -> rest lettuce on stove. But the user is in the garden again. So the next command should be "go north" to get back to the backyard, then "go west" to the kitchen. Then, rest the lettuce on the stove. So the current step is to go north from the garden.

Okay, the user is trying to rest the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen. The previous command "rest lettuce on stove" wasn't recognized. Maybe the correct verb is "put" instead of "rest". In many games, "put" is the standard verb for placing items. So the user should try "put lettuce on stove". Let me check the previous commands. The user had "pick up lettuce", which worked. So "put" might be the right verb here. The kitchen has a stove, so the command should be "put lettuce on stove".
