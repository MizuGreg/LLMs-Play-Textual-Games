Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, look and see that the chest drawer within the bedroom is opened. And then, recover the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. And then, unlock the wooden door. Then, open the wooden door within the bedroom. And then, go east. That done, open the refrigerator within the kitchen. After that, recover the apple from the refrigerator. Then, put the apple on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal kind of place.

You can make out a closed chest drawer in the corner. Oh, great. Here's an antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. However, the king-size bed, like an empty king-size bed, has nothing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps. The current situation is in the bedroom. They've already opened the chest drawer and found an old key. But the system tried to "recover the old key from the chest drawer" and got an error because "recover" isn't a recognized verb here.

So, the correct action would be to take the key. Since the key is in the chest drawer, the player needs to pick it up. The game's commands usually involve taking items when they're in reach. The previous step was opening the chest drawer, which revealed the key. Now, the next logical step is to take the key. The user might have confused "recover" with "take" or "pick up." In text adventures, "take" is the standard verb for picking up items. So the correct command here is "take old key" or "take key." Since the key is already in the chest drawer, which is open, "take old key" makes sense. The system should accept that command. The user's next action should be to take the key.

Okay, let's see. The user has successfully unlocked the wooden door leading east. The next step in the original instructions was to open the wooden door. Since the door is now unlocked, the next action should be to open it. The command would be "open wooden door". After that, they need to go east. Then, proceed to the kitchen, open the refrigerator, get the apple, put it on the stove. So the immediate next step is opening the door they just unlocked.

The user's previous action was unlocking the door, so the next command is "open wooden door".

-= Kitchen =-
You've stumbled into a normal room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be normal. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can make out a closed refrigerator. You can make out a counter. You shudder, but continue examining the counter. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You can make out a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove appears to be empty. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a kitchen island. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you make out a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, the user is in the kitchen now. The next step according to the original instructions was to open the refrigerator. So the next action should be "open refrigerator". Let me check the previous steps to make sure. The user had to go east from the bedroom, which led to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the refrigerator is closed. The user needs to open it. The command should be "open refrigerator". That's the next logical step after entering the kitchen.
