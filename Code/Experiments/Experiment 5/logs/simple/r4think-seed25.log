Welcome to another profound episode of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be good if you could ensure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is open. Then, take the old key from the chest drawer. And then, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. After that, ensure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is open. Then, go east. That done, ensure that the screen door in the kitchen is open. After pulling open the screen door, travel east. Then, move south. And then, retrieve the milk from the floor of the garden. Then, try to go to the north. Following that, move west. With that done, sit the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal kind of place.

You scan the room for a chest drawer, and you find a chest drawer. You can see an antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is ordinary. However, the king-size bed, like an empty king-size bed, has nothing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started by opening the chest drawer in the bedroom, took the old key, and now they need to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with that key. The next step according to the original plan was to make sure the wooden door is unlocked and then open it. So the next action should be to unlock the door with the old key. The user has already taken the key, so now they need to use it on the door. The command would be "unlock wooden door with old key" or something similar. But the exact phrasing might matter. Let me check the previous commands. The user was told to "make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key." So the correct command here is likely "unlock wooden door with old key". That's the next step.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started by opening the chest drawer, taking the old key, and then unlocking the wooden door. The next step according to the original plan was to ensure the wooden door inside the bedroom is open. Wait, the wooden door in the bedroom is already unlocked. But maybe the door is locked, and after unlocking, they need to open it?

Wait, the user just unlocked the wooden door. The next step in the original instructions was "ensure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is open." So maybe after unlocking, they need to open it. But the door might be locked, so unlocking is a prerequisite. So the next action should be to open the door. But the user has already unlocked it. Wait, maybe the door is locked, and after unlocking, they need to open it. So the next step is to open the door. But the user's last action was unlocking, so the next step is to open the door. Let me check the original steps again.

Original steps: After unlocking the wooden door, "ensure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is open." So the user needs to open the door. So the next action should be "open wooden door". But the user is in the bedroom, and the door is east. So the command would be "open wooden door" or "open door east". But in the game, the command might be "open wooden door". Alternatively, maybe the door is already unlocked, so the next step is to open it. So the correct next action is "open wooden door".

You can make out a refrigerator. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. The counter is standard. But the thing is empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You scan the room, seeing a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

The next step according to the original plan was to travel east after opening the screen door. So the next action should be "go east". The user has to make sure they continue following the sequence correctly. Let me check the previous steps again to confirm. Yes, after opening the screen door, the next command is indeed "go east". Then after that, they need to move south and retrieve the milk from the garden. So the next step here is definitely "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the original instructions. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. They opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden.

Now, in the garden, they found a lettuce, milk, a half bag of chips, and a shovel on the floor. The next step according to the original plan was to retrieve the milk from the floor of the garden. So the next action should be to pick up the milk. The user's last action was going south to the garden, so the next command should be "take milk from floor" or something similar. But the system message says to only output the action, like "go north". So the correct command here is "take milk from floor". But wait, in the game's context, maybe it's just "take milk" if it's on the floor. Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to "retrieve the milk from the floor of the garden." So the exact command would be "take milk from floor". But the assistant's previous commands were more direct, like "open chest drawer" instead of "open the chest drawer". So maybe "take milk from floor" is the correct action here. The user's next action should be that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps given in the original instructions. They've already opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the bedroom door, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden. In the garden, they tried to take the milk but couldn't because it was on the floor. Wait, the description says there's a milk on the floor. Maybe the previous attempt to take it failed because the command was wrong. Now, they need to retrieve the milk. The next step should be to pick up the milk from the floor. But the user tried "take milk from floor" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is just "take milk" or "take milk from floor". Let me check the previous interaction. The user said "take milk from floor" and the response was "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the milk is not visible, or the command is incorrect. Wait, in the garden description, it says "There is a lettuce, a milk, a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor." So the milk is there. Maybe the correct command is "take milk" without specifying the location. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first check the floor. But the user is supposed to take the milk from the floor. Maybe the correct command is "take milk from floor" but the game doesn't recognize it. Alternatively, maybe the milk is in a different location. Wait, the user is in the garden, and the milk is on the floor. So the correct action is to take the milk. Maybe the previous attempt was correct, but the game didn't register it. Or perhaps the user needs to use a different command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the garden and try again. But the user is already in the garden. The next step after failing to take the milk is to try again. So the next action should be "take milk" or "take milk from floor". Since the previous attempt with "take milk from floor" failed, maybe just "take milk" is the correct command. Let me check the game's possible commands. In TextWorld, the correct syntax would be "take milk" if it's in the current location. Since the milk is on the floor, maybe the correct command is just "take milk". So the user should try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Garden area, and they've already taken the milk. The next step in the original plan was to "try to go to the north" after retrieving the milk. But when they tried going north from the Garden, they ended up back in the Backyard. The user is now at the Garden again, and the next action should be to go north as per the original instructions.

Wait, the user just tried going north again, but the environment keeps looping between Garden and Backyard. The original goal was to sit the milk on the stove. But the stove is in the Kitchen. So maybe after getting the milk, the user needs to go back to the Kitchen, find the stove, and put the milk on it. However, the current location is the Garden, so the next step is to go north to reach the Backyard again, then find the path back to the Kitchen. But the user has already been through that path before. Maybe the user needs to go west from the Backyard through the screen door back to the Kitchen, then proceed to the stove. But the user's last action was going south again, which brings them back to the Garden. 

Wait, the user's score is at 9/16, which suggests they have completed most steps. The original plan was to retrieve the milk, then go north, then move west, then sit the milk on the stove. So after getting the milk in the Garden, the next step is to go north to the Backyard, then west through the screen door to the Kitchen, then find the stove. But the user is stuck in a loop between Garden and Backyard. Maybe the user needs to go west from the Backyard to the Kitchen. But the current location is the Garden, so they need to go north to Backyard, then west to Kitchen. Then, once in the Kitchen, they can go north to the dining room or something else where the stove is. But the user hasn't reached the stove yet. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go from the Garden north to Backyard, then west to Kitchen, then north again to the dining room, then find the stove. But the user's last action was going south, which brings them back to the Garden. So the next correct action after getting the milk is to go north to the Backyard, then west to the Kitchen, then proceed to the stove. But the user's current location is the Garden, so the next step is to go north. The user has already done that before, but maybe they need to proceed from there. So the next command should be "go north" again to reach the Backyard, then "go west" to the Kitchen, then "go north" to the dining room, and then "put milk on stove". But the user hasn't reached the stove yet. So the correct next action is to go north from the Garden to the Backyard.

-= Backyard =-
You arrive in a backyard. An ordinary one.

You can make out a set of chairs. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You see a bbq. The bbq appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can make out a patio table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The patio table appears to be empty.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a loop between the Garden and Backyard. They've been going back and forth between north and south, but the milk is already picked up. The original goal was to sit the milk on the stove. Wait, the user hasn't done that yet. But the current location is the Backyard. The stove is in the Kitchen, right? So maybe the next step is to go back to the Kitchen, then to the stove. But the user's last action was going north again. Maybe they need to find the path back to the Kitchen. Let me check the previous steps.

Earlier, the user went from Bedroom to Kitchen, then to Backyard, then to Garden. Now they're stuck in a loop. The milk is in the Garden, but they need to get to the stove. The stove is in the Kitchen. So the correct path would be from Garden, go north to Backyard, then go west through the screen door to Kitchen, then find the stove. But the user has been going south and north repeatedly. Maybe they need to go west from Backyard to get back to Kitchen. But the Backyard has an open screen door west, which leads back to the Kitchen. So the next action should be go west from Backyard to get back to Kitchen, then proceed to the stove. But the user's last action was go north, which is leading them back to Garden. So perhaps the correct next step is to go west from Backyard to get back to Kitchen. But the user might not realize that. Alternatively, maybe the user is stuck in a loop and needs to find the correct path. The answer should be to go west from Backyard to get back to Kitchen, then proceed to the stove. But the user's last action was go north, so maybe the next action should be go west. But the user is in Backyard, so the correct command is go west. But the user's previous steps show that they are not moving towards the Kitchen. So the next action should be go west from Backyard to get back to Kitchen. Then, once in Kitchen, they can go to the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is go west.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just walked into a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can make out a refrigerator. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. The counter is standard. But the thing is empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You scan the room, seeing a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Bathroom =-
You've entered a bathroom. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a toilet. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bath. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a sink. On the sink you make out a toothbrush.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the kitchen again after going through the bathroom and back. The original goal was to retrieve the milk from the garden and then sit it on the stove. But so far, the user has the milk. Now, the next step mentioned in the original instructions was "sit the milk on the stove." The user is in the kitchen, which has a stove mentioned. So the next logical step is to sit the milk on the stove. But wait, in the current kitchen description, the stove is mentioned as being empty. So the user needs to place the milk there. The command should be "sit milk on stove." But the game might require specific wording. Let me check the previous actions. The user took the milk from the garden and is now in the kitchen. The stove is in the kitchen, so the correct action is to put the milk on the stove. The exact command might be "put milk on stove" or "sit milk on stove." Since the user previously said "sit the milk on the stove," maybe "sit" is the correct verb here. But the game's previous responses might use "put." However, the user's last action was "go north" to the bathroom, then back to the kitchen. The next step is to put the milk on the stove. So the answer should be "put milk on stove" or "sit milk on stove." Looking at the previous interactions, when the user took the milk, they used "take milk," so maybe "put" is the right verb here. Therefore, the next action is "put milk on stove."
