You are now playing a life changing round of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, make absolutely sure that the antique trunk is ajar. Then, retrieve the old key from the antique trunk. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. And then, look and see that the wooden door is open. And then, make an attempt to head east. And then, open the refrigerator inside the kitchen. If you have opened the refrigerator, pick up the lettuce from the refrigerator. And then, sit the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk, which looks usual, right there by you. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the text adventure game. The goal seems to involve opening the wooden door in the bedroom, which requires using the old key. But the user tried to go east first, which wasn't allowed because the door was closed. Then they tried to open the door, but it needed unlocking with the key. Next, they tried to get the old key from the antique trunk, but the trunk was closed. The system message says the trunk is ajar, so maybe the user didn't open it yet.

Wait, the initial instruction said to make sure the antique trunk is ajar. The user might have missed that step. So the first thing is to open the trunk. Then retrieve the key. Then unlock the door. Then open the door. Then proceed east. Then go to the kitchen, open the fridge, get lettuce, put it on the stove.

But in the current state, the user tried to get the key from the trunk but couldn't because it was closed. So the correct action now is to open the antique trunk first. The user didn't do that yet. So the next step should be to open the trunk. Then get the key. Then unlock the door. Then open the door. Then go east. Then proceed with the kitchen tasks.

So the user's last action was trying to get the key from the trunk, but the trunk was closed. The system message says the trunk is ajar, but maybe the user didn't open it. Wait, the initial instruction said to make sure the trunk is ajar. So maybe the user needs to open it first. So the correct next action is to open the antique trunk. Then retrieve the key. Then unlock the door. Then open the door. Then go east. Then proceed to the kitchen.

So the user's current step is at 0/3, which might be the third step in the sequence. The user tried to get the key but couldn't because the trunk was closed. So the next action should be to open the trunk. Then get the key. Then unlock the door. Then open the door. Then go east. Then proceed to the kitchen.

Therefore, the correct next action is to open the antique trunk.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to achieve a goal. The current score is 4/7, and they've just opened the wooden door leading east. The original goal mentioned was to open the refrigerator in the kitchen, get the lettuce, and put it on the stove. 

So far, the player has made progress: they opened the antique trunk, got the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door. The next step mentioned in the initial instructions was to "make an attempt to head east." Since they've already opened the door, the next logical step would be to go through it.

The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. Given that they've successfully unlocked and opened the door, moving east makes sense. The next area would likely be the kitchen, where the refrigerator is located. So the correct action here is to go east, which would lead them to the kitchen. The player's next move should be "go east" to proceed to the kitchen and complete the remaining tasks.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

You make out a refrigerator, so there's that. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What's the point of an empty counter? You can see a stove. The stove is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You make out a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
