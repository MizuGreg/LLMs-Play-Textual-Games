Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First step, assure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is opened. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer. After that, make absolutely sure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. After that, open the wooden door inside the bedroom. After that, attempt to travel east. Following that, ensure that the refrigerator in the kitchen is open. And then, take the lettuce from the refrigerator inside the kitchen. And then, rest the lettuce on the stove. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You've stumbled into a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the bedroom.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a chest drawer. You make out a closed antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps to open the chest drawer, take the key, unlock the door, and now they've opened the door. The next step according to the original instructions was to open the wooden door inside the bedroom. Wait, the user just unlocked the door, so maybe the next step is to open it. But the user's last action was unlocking the door, and the score increased. Now, the next step in the original plan was to open the wooden door inside the bedroom. Wait, maybe the door is already open? Or maybe the user needs to open it after unlocking.

Wait, the user's last action was "unlock wooden door with old key", which was successful. The next step in the original instructions was "open the wooden door inside the bedroom." So the user needs to now open the door. So the next command should be "open wooden door". Then, after that, they need to attempt to travel east. So after opening the door, they can go east. Then, the next steps are to go to the kitchen, open the refrigerator, take lettuce, rest it on the stove.

So the next action here is to open the wooden door. The user has already unlocked it, but maybe it's still locked? Or maybe unlocking is different from opening. So the correct next step is to open the door. So the command should be "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. Then they tried to travel east, but the system kept saying "That's not a verb I recognise." Hmm, maybe the correct command is "go east" instead of "travel east"? The user has been using "travel east" three times, but the game doesn't recognize it. The previous successful commands were "open chest drawer", "take old key from chest drawer", "unlock wooden door with old key", "open wooden door". After opening the door, the next step should be moving east. Since "travel east" isn't working, maybe the correct verb is "go east". The user might have been using the wrong command. So the next action should be "go east" to move into the kitchen. Let me check the initial instructions again. The user was told to "attempt to travel east" after opening the door. But the game expects "go east" as the command. So the correct next step is "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen. The room is well lit.

You make out a closed refrigerator right there by you. You make out a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a stove. The stove is standard. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, the user is trying to follow a series of steps in a text-based game. Let me recap the current state to make sure I understand where they are.

First, they started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. In the kitchen, they opened the refrigerator, took the lettuce, but then tried to "rest lettuce on stove" which wasn't a valid command. The system responded with an error, and now the user is asked if they're on the right track and to provide the next command.

So, the next step after taking the lettuce would logically be to place it on the stove. Since "rest" isn't a valid verb here, maybe the correct action is "put" instead. The user might not know the exact command wording, so I need to suggest the correct verb. The game's commands are case-sensitive and specific, so "put lettuce on stove" is probably the right command. Let me check the previous interactions to confirm. Earlier, they used "take old key from chest drawer," so the structure is "verb noun from noun." But for putting, it's "put noun on noun." Therefore, the correct command should be "put lettuce on stove." That makes sense. The user might have used "rest" because they thought "rest" was a verb, but in the game's context, "put" is the correct action. So the next command should be "put lettuce on stove."
