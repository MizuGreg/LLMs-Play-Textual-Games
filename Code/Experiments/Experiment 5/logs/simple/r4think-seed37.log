Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! First, it would be fantastic if you could ensure that the chest drawer is open. After that, recover the old key from the chest drawer. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. And then, head east. And then, make absolutely sure that the screen door within the kitchen is wide open. After that, make an effort to go to the east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to go south. With that accomplished, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After that, try to venture north. Then, make an attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove within the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
I am excited to announce that you are now in the bedroom.

You see a closed chest drawer. You can make out an antique trunk. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can make out a king-size bed! But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the king-size bed.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've followed a series of steps. The goal was to open the chest drawer, get the old key, unlock the wooden door, open the door in the bedroom, go east, make sure the screen door in the kitchen is open, then go east again, south, pick up the milk, etc.

So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door. The current location is the bedroom, and the next step mentioned was to ensure the wooden door within the bedroom is open. Wait, the wooden door was already unlocked. But maybe it's closed? The user has to open it. Wait, the previous action was unlocking the door, but maybe the door is still closed. So the next step would be to open the wooden door.

But looking at the game's current state: after unlocking the door, the next prompt says "Do you think you're making the right actions..." So the user is at the bedroom, having unlocked the door. The next action according to the original plan was to ensure the wooden door is open. So maybe the user needs to open it. But the door was already unlocked. Wait, maybe "unlock" and "open" are different actions here. So even though the door is unlocked, it might still be closed. So the user needs to open it.

So the next command should be "open wooden door". Then, after that, go east. So the user's next action would be to open the door. Let me check the previous steps again. The user was told to "ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open" after unlocking it. So the user needs to open it. Therefore, the correct next action is "open wooden door".

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete a goal. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door in the bedroom, then went east into the kitchen. They opened the screen door there.

The original goal was to go through various doors and actions, including making sure the screen door in the kitchen is open, then going east, south, etc. The user is now in the kitchen, having opened the screen door. The next step according to the initial instructions was to "make an effort to go to the east" after opening the screen door. But since they're already in the kitchen, maybe they need to check if the screen door is open, which it is, and then proceed east. However, the kitchen has a closed refrigerator, a counter, a stove, and a note. The user might need to interact with these items, but the original plan was to go east again. Wait, the user just opened the screen door, which leads east. So the next action should be to go east. But the kitchen already has an exit to the north and a west door back to the bedroom. The user's next step might be to go north as per the hint in the kitchen description. But the original plan said after opening the screen door, go east. However, the screen door is already open, so maybe they should go east from the kitchen. But the kitchen's east door is the screen door, which is open. So the user should go east. But the user is in the kitchen, so going east would take them outside? Or maybe to another room. The user's next action should be to go east. But the user just opened the screen door, so maybe they need to go east. However, the kitchen's description says there's an exit to the north. But the user's next step in the original plan was to go east after opening the screen door. So the correct next action is to go east. But the user is in the kitchen, so going east would be through the screen door. So the next command should be "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in the game, opening doors, retrieving keys, moving through different rooms, and now they're in the Garden. The current task mentioned in the original instructions was to "lift the milk from the floor of the garden." The user has reached step 8 out of 9, so the next logical step would be to pick up the milk.

Looking at the Garden description, there's a milk on the floor. The user's last action was moving south to the Garden, and now they need to pick up the milk. The next command should be "take milk" or "lift milk." Since the game might use "take" as the verb, but the user's previous action was "lift" in the context of the milk, maybe "lift milk" is the correct command here. However, in many text adventures, "take" is the standard verb for picking up items. But the user's previous interaction had "lift the milk from the floor of the garden" as part of the original goal. So maybe the exact phrasing matters. Wait, the user's previous action was "go south" leading to the Garden, and the current step is to lift the milk. The correct command would be "lift milk" as per the original instruction. But I need to check the game's possible commands. Since the user previously used "take old key from chest drawer," maybe "take milk" is the right verb here. However, the original goal said "lift the milk," so perhaps "lift" is the correct verb. But the game might require "take." Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the game accepts "pick up milk." But the user's previous actions used "take" and "lift" depending on the context. In the Garden, the milk is on the floor, so "lift" might be appropriate. But I need to make sure. The user's last action was "go south," and the next step is to lift the milk. The correct command here is "lift milk." So the answer should be "lift milk."

Okay, the user is trying to play through this TextWorld game, and they've reached the Garden area. Their current task is to lift the milk from the floor. The user tried "lift milk" but got an error because the correct verb might be "pick up" instead. 

Looking at the previous interactions, the user has been using commands like "open", "take", "unlock", etc. In this context, "pick up" is more appropriate than "lift" because the milk is on the floor, and you'd typically pick it up rather than lift it. The game's response indicated that "lift" wasn't recognized, so the correct command should be "pick up milk".

The user's next step after lifting the milk is to rest it on the stove in the kitchen. So, after picking up the milk, they need to go back to the kitchen and place it on the stove. But first, they have to successfully pick up the milk. The user needs to correct the command to "pick up milk" to proceed.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in this text-based game. The original goal was to perform a sequence of actions starting from the bedroom, through the kitchen, backyard, and garden, ultimately lifting the milk and resting it on the stove.

So far, the user has successfully opened the chest drawer, recovered the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, moved east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden. In the garden, they picked up the milk. Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to "rest the milk on the stove within the kitchen."

The user is currently in the garden, having picked up the milk. The next logical step would be to go back to the kitchen to place the milk on the stove. The previous action was "pick up milk," which was corrected to "pick up milk" (though the system initially rejected "lift milk," but then accepted "pick up milk"). Now, the user needs to move north back to the kitchen, then rest the milk on the stove.

But the user's last action was "pick up milk," which was successful. The next command should be to go north to return to the kitchen. Once there, they can use the "rest milk on stove" command. However, the user's next input should be the command to move north. The assistant's response should be "go north" to return to the kitchen, then "rest milk on stove" once there. But since the user is in the garden, the immediate next step is to go north to the kitchen. So the correct next command is "go north."

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete a goal. The current scenario is in the Kitchen, and they just came from the Backyard. The user has already completed most of the required tasks: opened the chest drawer, recovered the key, unlocked and opened the bedroom door, went east to the Kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the Backyard, then south to the Garden, picked up the milk, and went north back to the Backyard. Now they're in the Kitchen again.

The next step according to the original instructions was to rest the milk on the stove within the kitchen. The user has the milk picked up, so the next logical action is to place it on the stove. The Kitchen description mentions a stove, so the command should be to put the milk on the stove. The user needs to use the correct verb here, which is "put" or "place". Since the game might expect a specific verb, "put" is more likely. So the correct command would be "put milk on stove".
