Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be great if you could make sure that the antique trunk is ajar. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk. Then, make it so that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. Then, ensure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is open. Then, take a trip east. And then, ensure that the screen door is open. After that, attempt to travel east. Okay, and then, make an effort to head south. Then, pick up the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. With the half of a bag of chips, attempt to go to the north. And then, try to travel west. Following that, sit the half of a bag of chips on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in a bedroom.

You see a closed chest drawer. You see an antique trunk. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the antique trunk, take the key, and now they need to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. The next step according to the original instructions was to make sure the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. So after taking the key, the next logical action would be to use it on the door.

Wait, the user just took the key, so the next command should be to unlock the door. The door is described as closed, so using the key on it should open it. Then, after unlocking, they need to open the door. So the steps are: unlock the door with the key, then open it. 

Looking at the previous actions, the user has already opened the trunk and taken the key. The next action should be to unlock the door. The command would be "unlock wooden door with old key". But in the game's context, maybe it's just "unlock wooden door" since the key is in hand. Alternatively, the game might require specifying the key. But based on the previous interactions, when they took the key, they didn't need to specify it again. So the next step is to unlock the door. Then open it. Then go east, etc.

So the next action is to unlock the wooden door. Then open it. So the next command is "unlock wooden door".

You see a refrigerator. You can see a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a kitchen island. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen now. The original goal was to follow a series of steps: open the trunk, get the key, unlock and open the bedroom door, go east, open the screen door, travel east again, then go south, pick up the chip half, go north, then west, and put the chip on the stove.

So far, they've done the first few steps: opened the trunk, took the key, unlocked and opened the bedroom door, then went east to the kitchen. Now, the next step in the original instructions was to "ensure that the screen door is open." The kitchen has a closed screen door leading east. So the next action should be to open that screen door.

The user is in the kitchen, and the screen door is closed. The command would be "open screen door". Let me check the previous steps to make sure. The user just arrived in the kitchen, and the screen door is closed. So the next step is to open it. Then, after that, they need to travel east again. So the next command is "open screen door".

Okay, the user has opened the screen door in the kitchen. The next step according to the original plan was to "attempt to travel east" after opening the screen door. So now, they should try going east. The screen door is open, so moving east through it makes sense. The command would be "go east".

Let me check the current location. The user is in the kitchen, and the screen door leading east is open. So "go east" is the next logical step. The previous action was opening the screen door, so now they need to move into the next area. The next part of the goal was to "travel east" again after handling the screen door. So the next command is "go east".

Okay, the user is in the Garden now. The original goal was to pick up the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. The current location has the half of a bag of chips on the floor. So the next action should be to pick it up. The command would be "take half of a bag of chips".

Let me check the current description. The garden has the half of a bag of chips on the floor. So the user needs to take it. After picking it up, the next step was to "attempt to go to the north" with the chips. So the next command after taking the chips would be "go north". But the user's next action now is to pick up the chips. So the correct command here is "take half of a bag of chips".

Okay, the user tried to take the half of a bag of chips but couldn't. Let me check the game state again. The garden has a half of a bag of chips on the floor. Maybe the command needs to be more specific. Perhaps "take half of a bag of chips" is not the correct syntax. Maybe it's "take half of a bag of chips from floor" but the game doesn't accept that. Alternatively, maybe the item is named differently. Wait, the user's previous command was "take half of a bag of chips from floor", but the game said "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the item is just "half of a bag of chips" and the command should be "take half of a bag of chips". Let me try that. Alternatively, maybe the game expects "pick up" instead of "take". But the user's previous command was "take", so maybe the correct command is "take half of a bag of chips". Let me try that again.

Okay, the user has been cycling between the Garden and Backyard, going back and forth. The original goal was to sit the half of a bag of chips on the stove. But in the current location, the user is in the Garden, which has a tomato plant, an apple, and a shovel on the floor. The Backyard has a patio table but nothing else. The user has the half of a bag of chips from earlier.

Wait, the last step was going north from the Garden to Backyard, then south back to Garden. The user needs to find the stove. The stove was mentioned in the Kitchen earlier. But the current location is the Garden. Maybe the user needs to go back to the Kitchen or another area where the stove is located. However, the user's previous steps have them moving between Garden and Backyard without encountering the stove yet.

Wait, the original instructions said to "sit the half of a bag of chips on the stove." The stove is in the Kitchen. So the user needs to go back to the Kitchen. But the current location is the Garden. The user needs to find a path back to the Kitchen. The Garden's description mentions an unblocked entranceway to the north, which leads to the Backyard. But the Kitchen was accessed earlier via the bedroom door. Maybe the user needs to go west from the Backyard through the screen door to the Kitchen. Let me check the previous steps.

In the Backyard, there's an open screen door leading west. So from Backyard, going west would lead to the Kitchen. So the next step should be to go west from the Backyard. But the user is currently in the Garden, so they need to go north to Backyard, then west to Kitchen. But the user's last action was going south from Backyard to Garden. So the next step is to go north again to Backyard, then west to Kitchen. But the user is in the Garden, so the next command should be "go north" to reach Backyard, then "go west" to Kitchen. However, the user's current location is Garden, so the immediate next action is "go north" to Backyard. Then from there, "go west" to Kitchen. But the user's last command was "go south", so they are back in Garden. Therefore, the next correct action is "go north" to Backyard, then "go west" to Kitchen. But the user needs to get to the Kitchen to find the stove. Once in the Kitchen, they can put the chips on the stove. So the next command is "go north" to reach Backyard, then "go west" to Kitchen. But the user is in Garden, so first "go north".

Okay, the user is in the Bathroom now. The original goal was to sit the half of a bag of chips on the stove. The stove is in the Kitchen, which was previously visited. The user has the half of a bag of chips from earlier. But now they're in the Bathroom, which doesn't seem related to the stove. The path back to the Kitchen would be south from the Bathroom. So the next step is to go south back to the Kitchen. Then, from the Kitchen, they can go north to the Bathroom again, but that's not helpful. Wait, the user needs to get back to the Kitchen to put the chips on the stove. So from the Bathroom, going south leads back to the Kitchen. Therefore, the next command should be "go south" to return to the Kitchen. Then, from the Kitchen, they can proceed to the stove area. But the user is currently in the Bathroom, so the immediate next action is "go south".

You see a refrigerator. You can see a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a kitchen island. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Bathroom =-
You are in a bathroom. An ordinary one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a toilet. You see a bath. You see a sink. The sink is standard. On the sink you can see a toothbrush.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
