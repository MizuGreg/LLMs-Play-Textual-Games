Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an fast paced round of TextWorld? You do! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, make sure that the chest drawer is wide open. After opening the chest drawer, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. Having got the old key, make sure that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. And then, open the wooden door. After that, travel east. That done, ensure that the refrigerator inside the kitchen is open. And then, recover the apple from the refrigerator. After taking the apple, rest the apple on the stove in the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. An ordinary kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a chest drawer. Now why would someone leave that there? If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The king-size bed is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a refrigerator. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a counter. The counter is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a stove. The stove is standard. But there isn't a thing on it. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. Oh, great. Here's a kitchen island. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you can make out a note. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has followed a series of steps to get the apple. They've opened the refrigerator, taken the apple, and now they're trying to rest the apple on the stove. The system keeps saying "That's not a verb I recognise" when they try to use "rest apple on stove". 

Wait, maybe the correct command is different. In TextWorld, commands are usually verbs followed by objects. The user tried "rest apple on stove", but the game might expect a different phrasing. Maybe "put apple on stove" instead of "rest"? Or perhaps "place apple on stove"? But the user has to use the exact command that the game accepts.

Looking back at the previous actions, the user used "take apple from refrigerator", so the structure is "verb object from noun". For putting the apple on the stove, maybe the correct command is "put apple on stove". The word "rest" might not be a valid verb here. The game might require "put" instead. 

Also, the user is asking if they're on the right track. They've completed the steps up to taking the apple, and now they need to place it on the stove. The next step after taking the apple was to rest it on the stove, but the game isn't recognizing that. So the correct action is likely "put apple on stove". 

The user's next move should be to use the correct verb. Since "rest" isn't working, they should try "put". So the next command should be "put apple on stove".
