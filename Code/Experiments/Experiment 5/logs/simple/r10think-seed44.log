Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to doublecheck that the antique trunk is opened. Then, recover the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. Having taken the old key, insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it. After that, look and see that the wooden door is ajar. And then, travel east. With that over with, ensure that the screen door is open. And then, attempt to move east. After that, make an attempt to go south. With that accomplished, lift the apple from the floor of the garden. After that, make an attempt to take a trip north. Then, go to the west. With that over with, put the apple on the stove. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An ordinary one.

Oh, great. Here's a chest drawer. You make out an antique trunk. Huh, weird. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what the next step should be here. The user is in the Living Room, and they've been following the instructions to complete certain tasks. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far.

First, they opened the antique trunk in the Bedroom and found an old key. Then they took the key, used it to unlock the wooden door, opened it, and went east into the Kitchen. From the Kitchen, they went south into the Living Room. Now, they're here, and the next part of the original instructions was to "lift the apple from the floor of the garden." But wait, the current location is the Living Room, not the Garden. Hmm, maybe I need to check if there's a path to the Garden yet.

Looking at the current description of the Living Room, there's a couch, a bell pepper, a low table with a remote, a TV, but no mention of a garden or an apple. The exits mentioned are north and possibly others, but the user's last action was going south from the Kitchen to the Living Room. The original plan was to go east from the Bedroom, then south from the Kitchen, but now in the Living Room, maybe the next step is to check the TV or the remote? Wait, the original goal mentioned lifting an apple from the garden. Maybe the apple is in the Kitchen or another room?

Wait, the user's score is at 5/8. The original instructions said after going east from the kitchen, attempt to move south, then take the apple from the garden. But the current location is the Living Room. Maybe the garden is another room, and the user needs to find a way there. Alternatively, maybe the apple is in the Living Room? But the description doesn't mention an apple here. The user might have missed a step.

Wait, the original instructions said: "After that, look and see that the wooden door is ajar. And then, travel east. With that over with, ensure that the screen door is open. And then, attempt to move east. After that, make an attempt to go south. With that accomplished, lift the apple from the floor of the garden. After that, make an attempt to take a trip north. Then, go to the west. With that over with, put the apple on the stove."

So after going east from the Bedroom (which was the Kitchen), then going south from the Kitchen (which led to the Living Room), then the next step was to lift the apple from the garden. But the user is in the Living Room now. So maybe the garden is a different room, and the user needs to find a way there. But the current room is the Living Room, which has no mention of a garden. Maybe the garden is accessible via the TV or the remote? Or perhaps the user needs to go north from the Living Room?

The Living Room's description says, "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north." So maybe the next step is to go north from the Living Room. But the original plan was to go south from the Kitchen, then lift the apple. Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the steps. Let me check again.

Original steps:

1. Open antique trunk (done)
2. Take old key (done)
3. Insert key into door lock (done)
4. Unlock door (done)
5. Open wooden door (done)
6. Go east (to Kitchen)
7. Go south (to Living Room)
8. Lift apple from garden (but where is the garden?)

So the user is now in the Living Room, but the apple is in the garden. So the user needs to find a way to the garden. The current room is the Living Room. The exits from the Living Room are north (as per the description) and possibly others. But the description doesn't mention a garden here. Maybe the garden is connected via the TV or another object? Or perhaps the user needs to go north from the Living Room to reach the garden?

Alternatively, maybe the garden is the Kitchen? But the Kitchen was already visited. Wait, the original instruction said to lift the apple from the garden, so it's a separate room. The user hasn't found the garden yet. So the next step would be to go north from the Living Room, which is the next unblocked exit. Let's check the Living Room's description again: "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north." So the user should go north from here. That would take them to the next room, perhaps the Garden. Then, once there, they can lift the apple. So the next action is to go north.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've been following a set of steps to progress. The original goal was to double-check the antique trunk, get the old key, unlock the door, move east, open the screen door, take the apple from the garden, put it on the stove, and then proceed north, west, etc.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Living Room again, and the score is 5/12. The previous steps involved moving between the Bedroom, Kitchen, and Living Room. The user has already opened the wooden door, inserted the key, unlocked it, and moved east to the Kitchen. Then they went south to the Living Room again.

The next steps mentioned in the original instructions were: after moving east and opening the screen door, lift the apple from the garden, take a trip north, go west, put the apple on the stove. But in the current scenario, the user is in the Living Room, and the score is 5/12. It seems like they might be stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Living Room.

Wait, the user's last action was "go north" which took them back to the Kitchen. Now they're in the Kitchen again, score 5/11. Then they tried "go south" again, back to the Living Room (5/12). The user is probably not progressing towards the apple in the garden yet. The original plan mentioned going east from the bedroom, but maybe the garden is in a different part of the map.

Alternatively, maybe the user hasn't found the apple yet. The instructions said to "lift the apple from the floor of the garden" after unlocking the door and moving east. But in the current path, the user hasn't reached the garden. Perhaps the garden is beyond the screen door in the Kitchen? The Kitchen has a closed screen door leading east. Maybe the garden is east of the Kitchen. So the next step would be to open the screen door, go east to the garden, pick up the apple, then proceed to the stove.

But the user's current position is in the Living Room (5/12). The previous steps might have missed going east from the Kitchen. Let me check the previous moves. The user went from Bedroom to Kitchen (east), then south to Living Room, then north back to Kitchen. Now, in the Kitchen, the screen door is closed. So the next logical step is to open the screen door, go east to the garden, pick up the apple, then go back north to the Living Room, then west to the Kitchen, then maybe to the Bedroom again? Wait, but the original plan was to put the apple on the stove. The stove is in the Kitchen. So after getting the apple, the user would need to go to the stove, put it there, then proceed further.

But the user's current score is 5/12, which suggests they haven't completed the steps yet. The original goal required several actions: open trunk, get key, unlock door, move east, open screen door, get apple, take trip north, go west, put apple on stove. So maybe the user hasn't reached the garden yet. The screen door in the Kitchen is closed, so they need to open it. Then go east to the garden, pick up the apple. Then return to the Kitchen, go north to the Living Room, then west to the Kitchen again, then maybe to the Bedroom? Wait, but the original plan said after putting the apple on the stove, they could stop. So the stove is in the Kitchen. So after getting the apple, they need to go to the stove, put it there, then maybe proceed further.

So the next step would be to open the screen door in the Kitchen (which is closed), then go east to the garden, pick up the apple, then return to the Kitchen, go to the stove, put the apple there. Then proceed as per the original plan.

But in the current state, the user is in the Living Room (5/12). The previous action was "go north" which took them back to the Kitchen (5/11). Then "go south" back to Living Room (5/12). So the user hasn't opened the screen door yet. The screen door is in the Kitchen, leading east. So the next action should be to open the screen door, then go east to the garden. Therefore, the correct next command is "open screen door".

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld. The goal seems to be to complete a series of tasks, like opening the antique trunk, getting the old key, unlocking the door, and then moving through different rooms, eventually getting the apple and putting it on the stove.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Living Room, and the score is 5/16. The previous actions involved moving between the Bedroom, Kitchen, and Living Room, opening and closing doors, and trying to find items. However, the user hasn't found the apple yet, which is part of the original goal.

The user's last action was "go north", which took them back to the Kitchen. Now, they're in the Living Room again, and the prompt asks if they're on the right track and what their next move should be. The user is probably stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Living Room, not making progress towards the apple or the stove.

The original goal mentioned lifting the apple from the garden and putting it on the stove. So far, the user hasn't encountered the garden or the apple. Maybe they need to go east through the screen door, but earlier attempts to open it failed. Alternatively, maybe they need to find another path or item that leads them to the garden.

But in the current room (Living Room), the only exits mentioned are north to the Kitchen and south (but the south exit was blocked earlier). Wait, the Living Room's description says "You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north." So maybe the south exit is blocked, and the only way is north again. However, the user is looping between Kitchen and Living Room without progressing.

Perhaps the user needs to check the kitchen island for the note mentioned. The kitchen has a note, which might be a clue. Or maybe the low table in the Living Room has the remote, but that's just a remote. The bell pepper on the couch might be a red herring.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east through the screen door, but it's closed. The user tried "open screen door" earlier, but the game said they couldn't see it. So maybe the screen door is not in the Living Room but in the Kitchen. The Kitchen has a closed screen door leading east. If the user can open that, they might exit to the garden.

But the user hasn't tried opening the screen door in the Kitchen yet. The current location is the Living Room, so maybe they need to go back to the Kitchen, open the screen door, and then proceed east to the garden. That would make sense as the next step. However, the user's last action was "go north" to the Kitchen, and now they're back in the Living Room. So the next step should be to go back to the Kitchen and try opening the screen door.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld, and they've been following a set of instructions to complete certain tasks. The goal seems to be to collect items, unlock doors, and move through different rooms to achieve the original objective, which the user hasn't explicitly stated but implies through the steps.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Kitchen again, and the score is at 5/19. The previous actions involved moving between the Bedroom, Kitchen, and Living Room, opening and closing doors, and trying to find items like the old key and an apple. However, the user hasn't mentioned finding the apple yet, which was part of the original instructions. The current room (Kitchen) has a note on the kitchen island, but no apple is mentioned here.

The user's last action was "go north," which led them back to the Kitchen. The score hasn't increased, so maybe they're stuck in a loop. The original goal mentioned lifting the apple from the garden and putting it on the stove, but the current location is the Kitchen, not the Garden. The user might need to find the apple in the Garden, which is probably accessible through another path.

Wait, the user was instructed to "travel east" after unlocking the door, which led them to the Kitchen. Then they tried going south to the Living Room, but that didn't help. The Garden hasn't been visited yet. Maybe the Garden is east of the Kitchen, but the screen door is closed. The user tried opening the screen door but got a message saying they can't see any such thing. Maybe the screen door is not in the Kitchen but in another room.

Alternatively, the user might have missed a step. The original instructions said to "ensure that the screen door is open" after moving east. But in the current state, the screen door is closed. However, the user tried to open it and was told they can't see it. Maybe the screen door is in the Living Room, not the Kitchen. But the current location is the Kitchen, so perhaps they need to go back to the Living Room and check there.

Wait, the user is in the Kitchen, and the Living Room is to the north. The user tried going north and south repeatedly, which might be causing the loop. The original goal requires moving to the Garden, which might be east of the Kitchen. But the screen door is closed. The user needs to open it, but they can't see it. Maybe the screen door is in the Kitchen, but the game's description says it's closed. However, the user tried to open it and was told they can't see it, which might be a mistake in the game's design.

Alternatively, the user might need to find the apple in the Garden, which is part of the original goal. The user hasn't found the apple yet, so they need to navigate to the Garden. The Garden might be accessible through the screen door in the Kitchen, but it's closed. The user needs to open it, but the game's message says they can't see it. This could be a bug or a misdirection.

Given the current state, the user is in the Kitchen, and the next logical step would be to check the kitchen island for the note mentioned. The note might have clues about the apple or the Garden. Alternatively, the user might need to go back to the Living Room and check there for the apple, but the Living Room doesn't mention an apple. The original instructions said to "lift the apple from the floor of the garden," so the Garden must be the next location.

The user's next action should be to go east through the screen door, even though the game says they can't see it. Maybe the screen door is in the Kitchen, and the user needs to open it. The previous attempt to open it failed, but perhaps the user should try again. Alternatively, the user might need to find another way to the Garden.

Given the instructions, after unlocking the door and moving east to the Kitchen, the next step was to ensure the screen door is open. The user tried opening it but got a message. Maybe the screen door is in the Kitchen, and the user needs to open it. The correct action would be to open the screen door, even if the game says they can't see it. Alternatively, the user might need to go to the Garden through another path.

In summary, the user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Living Room. The next step should be to try opening the screen door in the Kitchen, even though the game says they can't see it. Alternatively, the user might need to find the apple in the Garden, which is probably accessible through the screen door. The correct action here is to open the screen door east, even if the game's message is confusing.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. The goal seems to be to follow a series of steps to reach the original goal, which isn't explicitly stated, but from the initial instructions, it probably involves opening the screen door, moving east, then going south, north, west, and finally putting the apple on the stove.

So far, the user has opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, and then went east to the kitchen. Then they kept going back and forth between the kitchen and living room, trying to go north and south. Then they tried to open the screen door, which they did, and now they're in the kitchen again with the screen door open.

The next step mentioned in the original instructions was after opening the screen door, attempt to move east. So after opening the screen door, the user should try going east. The system message says to only output the action, so the correct command here would be "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user has been going through various rooms in the game, starting from the bedroom, then kitchen, living room, backyard, and now the garden. The original goal mentioned was to lift the apple from the garden and put it on the stove. 

Looking at the current location, the Garden room has a tomato plant, milk, an apple, and a shovel on the floor. The user's next step would be to pick up the apple. The previous actions included moving to the garden, so the next logical command is to take the apple. The user's score has been increasing, and they've successfully navigated through several areas. The apple is explicitly mentioned as being on the floor, so using "take apple" makes sense here. The user needs to collect the apple to proceed with the next step of putting it on the stove. Therefore, the correct action is to take the apple.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the instructions in the TextWorld game. The original goal was to recover the old key, unlock the door, go through the rooms, and eventually put the apple on the stove. 

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Garden. The description mentions a tomato plant, milk, an apple, and a shovel on the floor. The user tried to take the apple from the floor, but the game said they can't see any such thing. Wait, but the description explicitly lists the apple as being on the floor. Maybe there's a typo or a misunderstanding in the game's response.

But the user's previous action was "take apple from floor", and the game responded with "You can't see any such thing." That's confusing because the garden description does mention the apple is on the floor. Maybe the game's parser isn't recognizing the apple as being there. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is just "take apple" without specifying the floor, since the apple is already on the floor.

Wait, in TextWorld, sometimes you have to use the correct syntax. If the apple is on the floor, the command might just be "take apple" instead of "take apple from floor". The game might be expecting "take apple" because the apple is already in the current location. Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to "lift the apple from the floor of the garden" in the initial instructions. So maybe the correct command is "take apple" or "lift apple".

But the user tried "take apple from floor" and it didn't work. Maybe the game expects "take apple" without the "from floor" part. Let me think. In many text adventures, if an item is on the floor, you just say "take apple" and the game picks it up. The "from floor" part might be redundant or incorrect. So the next action should be "take apple" to pick it up. Then, after taking the apple, the user needs to go north to the kitchen and put the apple on the stove. But the user's next step is to take the apple, so the correct command here is "take apple".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been moving through different rooms. The goal seems to involve collecting items and navigating through various areas. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far.

Starting in the Bedroom, they opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked the door, and went east to the Kitchen. Then they moved around, going south to the Living Room, north again, and eventually to the Backyard and Garden. In the Garden, they picked up the apple. Now, they're back in the Kitchen, and the next step is to put the apple on the stove.

Wait, the original instructions mentioned: "Once that's all handled, put the apple on the stove." So after collecting the apple in the Garden, they need to take it back to the Kitchen and put it on the stove. The user has the apple now, as they picked it up in the Garden. The current location is the Kitchen, so the next logical step is to put the apple on the stove. The stove is in the Kitchen, so the command should be "put apple on stove".

I need to make sure that the command is correctly formatted. The user has the apple, so they can directly put it on the stove here. The previous steps have already handled the key and door parts, so this is the final action needed. The score is increasing, so each correct action contributes to the goal. Therefore, the next action is to put the apple on the stove.
