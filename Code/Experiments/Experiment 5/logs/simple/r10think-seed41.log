Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to ensure that the antique trunk is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk within the bedroom. After that, unlock the wooden door. After that, open the wooden door. And then, venture east. Okay, and then, ensure that the refrigerator is open. And then, retrieve the tomato plant from the refrigerator in the kitchen. If you have taken the tomato plant, place the tomato plant on the stove within the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a bedroom.

You can make out a closed chest drawer right there by you. You can see a closed antique trunk nearby. Look over there! a king-size bed. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a king-size bed, go to TextWorld. The king-size bed is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

Oh, great. Here's a refrigerator. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. The counter is normal. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You see a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You make out a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.
