Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to doublecheck that the antique trunk is opened. Then, recover the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. Having taken the old key, insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it. After that, look and see that the wooden door is ajar. And then, travel east. With that over with, ensure that the screen door is open. And then, attempt to move east. After that, make an attempt to go south. With that accomplished, lift the apple from the floor of the garden. After that, make an attempt to take a trip north. Then, go to the west. With that over with, put the apple on the stove. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An ordinary one.

Oh, great. Here's a chest drawer. You make out an antique trunk. Huh, weird. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game called TextWorld. The goal seems to be a series of specific actions they need to follow. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far.

First, they were in the bedroom and found an antique trunk. They opened it and took an old key. The score increased each time they completed a step. The next step in the initial instructions was to insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. Then, after unlocking, they needed to check if the door is ajar, move east, ensure the screen door is open, move east again, try to go south, pick up an apple from the garden, take a trip north, go west, put the apple on the stove, and then stop.

So far, the user has completed the first two steps: opening the trunk and taking the key. The next step according to the instructions is to insert the key into the wooden door's lock. The current location is the bedroom, and there's a closed wooden door leading east. The user needs to use the old key to unlock it. 

The user's next action should be to use the key on the door. The command would be "use old key on wooden door" or something similar. But in the game's context, the correct command might be "unlock wooden door with old key" or "insert old key into wooden door". However, based on the previous commands the user used ("open antique trunk", "take old key from antique trunk"), the next logical step is to use the key on the door. 

The user's previous actions were "open antique trunk" and "take old key from antique trunk". The next step is to insert the key into the door's lock. The correct command here would be "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with old key". But since the game might expect a specific syntax, maybe "insert old key into wooden door". However, the user's previous commands were more about interacting with objects directly. 

Looking at the initial instructions: "insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it." So the action is to insert the key into the door's lock. The correct command here would be "insert old key into wooden door". But the user might need to first approach the door. However, in the current location, the wooden door is already present. So the next step is to insert the key into the door's lock. 

Therefore, the next action should be "insert old key into wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is in the bedroom, has the old key, and just unlocked the wooden door leading east. The next step according to the original instructions was to check if the door is ajar, then move east, ensure the screen door is open, move east again, try to go south, pick up an apple, etc.

So after unlocking the door, the next logical step is to open the door. The user needs to make sure the door is ajar. The command would be "open wooden door" or "push wooden door". But since the door was just unlocked, maybe it's already open. However, the instruction says "look and see that the wooden door is ajar", so maybe the user needs to check it. But the game might require an action to open it. Alternatively, the door might be unlocked but not open, so the user needs to push it open.

The previous action was "unlock wooden door with old key", and the response was "You unlock wooden door." So the door is now unlocked. The next step is to open it. The correct command here would be "open wooden door" or "push wooden door east". Since the door is leading east, maybe "push wooden door east" to open it. But the user needs to first check if it's ajar. However, the game might require the user to open it. So the next action should be "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is in the kitchen now. The previous steps were unlocking the door, opening it, and moving east to the kitchen. The next steps according to the original instructions were to ensure the screen door is open, then move east again, attempt to go south, pick up the apple from the garden, etc.

In the kitchen, there's a closed screen door leading east. The user needs to make sure that screen door is open. The instruction says "ensure that the screen door is open" before moving east. So the next action should be to open the screen door. The command would be "open screen door" or "push screen door east". Since the screen door is closed, the correct command is "open screen door".

Okay, the user tried to take the apple from the floor but got a message saying "You can't see any such thing." Wait, the garden description mentioned "a tomato plant, a milk, an apple and a shovel on the floor." So the apple is there. Maybe the command needs to be more specific. Instead of "take apple from floor", maybe "take apple" alone would work. Let me check the previous commands. The user had to "lift the apple from the floor of the garden" according to the initial instructions. So the correct command should be "take apple" or "lift apple from floor". Since the game might require the exact phrasing, maybe "lift apple from floor" is needed. But the user tried "take apple from floor" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is just "take apple". Let me try that.
