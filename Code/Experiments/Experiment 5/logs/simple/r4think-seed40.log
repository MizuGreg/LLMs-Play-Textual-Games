-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in the bedroom.

You can make out a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. However, the king-size bed, like an empty king-size bed, has nothing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the chest drawer, pick up the key, unlock and open the wooden door. So far, they've completed the first four steps out of five mentioned in the initial instructions. The next step according to the original plan was to venture east. But wait, the current location is the bedroom, and after opening the wooden door, maybe they need to check what's east of the door.

But the user's last action was opening the wooden door, and the next prompt is asking if they're on the right track. The user is probably expecting to move east now. The original instructions said after opening the door, venture east, then move south. So the next action should be going east. The user's response should be "go east" to continue the sequence. Let me make sure there's no other step in between. The initial plan was: open chest, pick key, unlock door, open door, go east, move south, take bell pepper from couch, go north, rest on stove. So after opening the door, the next is east. So the correct command is "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the kitchen.

You see a closed refrigerator right there by you. You scan the room, seeing a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

You are in a living room. A normal kind of place.

Oh, great. Here's a couch. The couch is typical. On the couch you can see a bell pepper. You see a low table. You see a remote on the low table. You can make out a tv! The tv is usual. However, the tv, like an empty tv, has nothing on it. You move on, clearly upset with your TextWorld experience.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

Okay, the user is trying to rest the bell pepper on the stove in the kitchen. The previous action was "rest bell pepper on stove", but the game responded that it's not a recognized verb. So, I need to figure out the correct command.

First, let me recall the game's context. The player has the bell pepper, and the goal is to rest it on the stove in the kitchen. The error message suggests that "rest" isn't a valid verb here. Maybe the correct action is to put the bell pepper on the stove instead of resting it.

In TextWorld games, common verbs for placing items are "put" or "place". So instead of "rest", the player should use "put". The correct command would be "put bell pepper on stove". Let me check if that's the right syntax. The game might expect "put" as the verb. Since "rest" isn't working, switching to "put" makes sense.

Also, the user's previous actions involved picking up items and moving between rooms. The next step after taking the bell pepper was to go north, but that led back to the kitchen. Now, the player is in the kitchen again and needs to place the bell pepper on the stove. So the correct action is to use "put" instead of "rest".
