Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to open the chest drawer within the bedroom. After that, recover the old key from the chest drawer. Then, unlock the wooden door within the bedroom. And then, assure that the wooden door is ajar. After opening the wooden door, attempt to move east. Then, make sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is ajar. After pulling open the screen door, take a trip east. Following that, make an effort to venture south. With that accomplished, pick up the milk from the floor of the garden. Then, head north. Next, try to go west. With that accomplished, rest the milk on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A standard one.

Were you looking for a chest drawer? Because look over there, it's a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. Look over there! a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, but tried to push it open and failed. Now, they're at a point where they need to make sure the door is ajar.

Wait, the previous step was trying to push the wooden door open, but the game said they can't see any such thing. Then they tried to unlock the door again, but it's already unlocked. The next step according to the original instructions was to assure the wooden door is ajar. Since the door is already unlocked, maybe they need to open it manually. But the user tried to push it and it didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to open the door instead of pushing? Or perhaps there's another step needed.

Looking back at the original instructions: after unlocking the door, they need to "assure that the wooden door is ajar." So maybe the door is unlocked but not open. The user tried to push it, which might not be the right action. The correct action might be to open the door. But in text adventures, sometimes "open" is the command. Alternatively, maybe "push" is the right verb here. But the game said "You can't see any such thing" when they tried to push. That might mean that pushing isn't the right action. Maybe they need to use the key again? But the door is already unlocked. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the door is locked but they've already unlocked it. Wait, the user had to unlock the door with the key, and then the door is unlocked. Now, they need to open it. So the next step is to open the door. The game might expect the command "open wooden door" instead of pushing. Let me check the previous steps. The user tried "push wooden door open" and it failed. So maybe the correct action is "open wooden door". Let me try that.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, pushed it open, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden. In the garden, they tried to take the milk but couldn't.

The current state in the garden is that there's a lettuce, milk, half a bag of chips, and a shovel on the floor. The user tried "take milk from floor" but got a "can't see any such thing" response. Wait, maybe the milk is not directly on the floor? Or maybe the command needs to be more precise. Let me check the previous messages.

In the garden description, it says: "There is a lettuce, a milk, a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor." So the milk is indeed on the floor. But when the user tried "take milk from floor", the game said they can't see it. That's confusing. Maybe the correct command is just "take milk" without specifying the floor? Or perhaps the game expects a different phrasing.

Wait, the user's last action was "take milk from floor", which failed. The next step is to figure out the correct command. Since the milk is on the floor, maybe the correct command is "take milk" alone. Let me think about how these games usually work. Often, you just need to pick up the item by name if it's in the same room. So maybe the error is because the user specified "from floor" when it's not necessary. The game might be expecting "take milk" instead.

So the next action should be "take milk" without the "from floor" part. That makes sense. The user's previous attempt included "from floor", which might not be the right syntax. So the correct command is just "take milk".

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to win. The goal is to perform a bunch of actions in a specific order.

First, they started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, pushed it open, then went east to the kitchen. Then they had to open the screen door, go east again to the backyard, then south to the garden where they picked up the milk. Then they went north back to the backyard, west to the kitchen, north to the bathroom, and back south to the kitchen again. It seems like they're stuck in a loop between the kitchen and bathroom, going back and forth.

The user is now at the kitchen again, and the assistant is supposed to give the next command. The previous actions led to a loop, so maybe the next step is to try going south again from the kitchen, but the system message says to only output the action. However, the user's last action was "go north" which led them back to the bathroom. The next logical step might be to go south again to exit the bathroom and return to the kitchen. But the user has been looping here multiple times, so maybe there's a different path. However, based on the previous interactions, the only available exits from the kitchen are north to the bathroom and south, which is unblocked. Since the user has been going back and forth between kitchen and bathroom, the next action should be to go south again to exit the bathroom and return to the kitchen. But the user's last action was "go north" leading to the bathroom, so the next step would be to go south from the bathroom. But the user's last input was "go north" in the kitchen, leading to the bathroom. So the next action should be "go south" from the bathroom to return to the kitchen. However, the user is at the kitchen again, so maybe the correct next step is to go south again from the kitchen. But the system message says to only output the command. So the answer is "go south".

-= Living Room =-
Ah, the living room. This is some kind of living room, really great usual vibes in this place, a wonderful usual atmosphere. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can see a couch. The couch is standard. On the couch you see a tomato plant. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a low table. You see a remote on the low table. You can see a tv. You shudder, but continue examining the tv. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an unguarded exit to the north.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to win. The goal is to perform a series of actions in specific rooms and finally rest the milk on the stove.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Kitchen again, and the score is at 9/34. The previous steps involved moving between rooms, opening doors, collecting items like the milk, and navigating through different areas. The user has already collected the milk in the Garden and is now back in the Kitchen after moving through the Bathroom and Living Room.

The next step according to the original plan was to rest the milk on the stove. But the user is currently in the Kitchen, which has a stove mentioned. However, the user hasn't placed the milk on the stove yet. The current room description mentions a stove that's normal but empty. The user has the milk in their inventory, as they picked it up in the Garden.

So the correct action here would be to place the milk on the stove. The command should be "put milk on stove" or something similar. But in the game's context, the exact command might be "rest milk on stove" as per the original instructions. The user needs to execute that action to complete the goal.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete a series of tasks in this text-based game. They've successfully opened the chest drawer, taken the key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, moved east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, south to the garden, picked up the milk, and then tried to go north and west, ending up in the kitchen again.

The current step was to "rest the milk on the stove" to win the game. But the system keeps saying that's not a recognized verb. So, maybe the correct command isn't "rest milk on stove" but something else. Let me think about possible commands in the game's context.

In many text adventures, you can't just "rest" an item on a surface; you might need to use a different verb like "put" or "place". The user might have to use "put milk on stove" instead. Alternatively, maybe the stove is a receptacle, and the correct action is to put the milk there. Since "rest" isn't a valid verb here, the user should try "put milk on stove" or "place milk on stove". 

Looking back at the game's previous interactions, the user was told to "rest the milk on the stove" but the system didn't recognize it. So the correct command is likely "put milk on stove". The user has been repeating "rest milk on stove", but since that's not working, they need to try the correct verb. Therefore, the next action should be "put milk on stove".
