You are now playing a life changing game of TextWorld! First stop, open the antique trunk. After pulling open the antique trunk, take the old key from the antique trunk within the bedroom. If you can get your hands on the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. And then, look and see that the wooden door is ajar. After that, try to go east. Then, try to move south. After that, retrieve the lettuce from the couch. And then, try to head north. Then, place the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. An ordinary one.

You can see a closed chest drawer in the corner. You see an antique trunk. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a king-size bed. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game. They started by opening the antique trunk, taking the old key, unlocking the wooden door, and now they're at the door. The next step according to the original instructions was to "look and see that the wooden door is ajar." But since the door was already unlocked, maybe the next action is to check if it's open. However, the user might need to "look" at the door to confirm it's ajar. But the game's response after unlocking the door might have already indicated that it's open. Wait, the user's last action was unlocking the door, and the score increased. Now, the next step in the original plan was to "try to go east." But the user needs to check if the door is ajar first. However, the game's current state might have the door open after unlocking. So the next action should be to go east. But the user needs to make sure the door is open. Alternatively, maybe the door is now open, so they can proceed. The user's next action should be to go east. Let me check the original instructions again. After unlocking the door, the next step was to "look and see that the wooden door is ajar." So maybe the user needs to look at the door to confirm. But in the game, after unlocking, the door might be open. So the next action would be to go east. But the user's last action was unlocking the door, and the next step is to go east. So the correct command is "go east."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to open the wooden door, but the game isn't recognizing "open" as a verb. Earlier, they unlocked the door with the key, but maybe the door is still locked even though it was unlocked? Wait, the instructions said after unlocking, the door should be ajar. But the game's response says the door is closed. Maybe there's a mistake here. The user tried "try to open the wooden door" again, but the system keeps saying it's not a verb. Maybe the correct command is "open the wooden door" instead of "try to open". Or perhaps the game expects a different verb like "push" or "pull". But the user tried "push" earlier and it wasn't recognized. Hmm. The original plan was to unlock the door, then check if it's ajar, then go east. But the door is closed again. Maybe the user needs to use the key again? Wait, they already used the key to unlock it. Maybe the door is locked again, so they need to unlock it again. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked from the other side. Wait, the initial instruction said after unlocking, the door is ajar. But the game's response says it's closed. Maybe there's a bug, but the user has to proceed. The next action should be to try opening the door again, but using the correct command. Since "open" isn't working, maybe "use the key on the door"? But the key is already used. Alternatively, "push the door". But the game said "push" wasn't a verb. Maybe the correct command is "open the door". Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "try to open the wooden door" and it was rejected. Maybe the correct command is "open the wooden door" without "try to". Let's try that.

You are in a kitchen. An usual kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You see a refrigerator. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is standard. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a stove. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Wow! Just like in the movies!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's recap the user's progress so far. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and then tried to open it again. After some confusion, they successfully opened the door and moved east to the kitchen. Then they went north to the bathroom and back south to the kitchen.

The original goal was to retrieve the lettuce from the couch, place it on the stove in the kitchen, and then win. The user hasn't mentioned retrieving the lettuce yet. In the kitchen, they saw a kitchen island with a note, but no lettuce. The next step would be to look for the lettuce. Since the user is in the kitchen now, they should check the couch mentioned earlier. Wait, the couch was in the bedroom. But the user moved to the kitchen and bathroom. Maybe the lettuce is on the kitchen island or somewhere else. However, according to the original instructions, the lettuce is on the couch in the bedroom. But the user hasn't gone back to the bedroom. Alternatively, maybe the lettuce is in the kitchen. The user needs to check the kitchen island or the counter. But the original plan said to retrieve the lettuce from the couch. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake in the steps. Wait, the user is in the kitchen now. The next action should be to go back to the bedroom to get the lettuce. But the user has to follow the original steps: after unlocking the door, go east, then south, then retrieve the lettuce from the couch. Wait, the original instructions said: "After that, retrieve the lettuce from the couch. And then, try to head north. Then, place the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen." So the lettuce is on the couch in the bedroom. But the user is in the kitchen. So they need to go back to the bedroom, get the lettuce, then go north to the kitchen and place it on the stove. But the user is currently in the kitchen. So the next step is to go west back to the bedroom, get the lettuce, then go north to the kitchen again and place it. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the current location is the kitchen, and the next action should be to go west to the bedroom to retrieve the lettuce. But the user's last action was going south to the kitchen. So they need to go west to the bedroom. But the kitchen's description says there's an open wooden door leading west, which would be back to the bedroom. So the next command should be "go west" to return to the bedroom, then retrieve the lettuce from the couch. Then go north to the kitchen again and place it on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next action is to go west back to the bedroom.

Okay, the user is in the bedroom and needs to retrieve the lettuce from the couch. The previous attempt to use "retrieve" was rejected. Maybe the correct verb is "take" instead. Let me check the game's possible commands. Earlier, the user took the old key from the trunk, so "take" was valid. Maybe "take the lettuce from the couch" is the correct command. Alternatively, "get the lettuce from the couch". But the game might expect a specific verb. Since "retrieve" didn't work, trying "take" instead. Let's try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the bedroom and needs to find the lettuce from the couch. They tried "retrieve the lettuce from the couch" but it wasn't recognized. Then they tried "look at the couch", but the game didn't understand. Maybe the correct command is just "look" without specifying the couch. Alternatively, maybe the lettuce is on the kitchen island, and the user needs to go back to the kitchen. Wait, the original plan was to retrieve the lettuce from the couch in the bedroom.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to find the lettuce from the couch as per the original plan. But in the bedroom, they've checked the couch, bed, chest drawer, and antique trunk. The trunk is open but empty. The lettuce wasn't there. Then they went back to the kitchen, took a note, and now back in the bedroom. Maybe the lettuce was on the kitchen island, but the user didn't check there before. Wait, in the kitchen, the kitchen island has a note, but the lettuce wasn't mentioned. The original goal said to retrieve the lettuce from the couch, but maybe it's a trick and the lettuce is actually in the kitchen. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen again and check the stove or counter. But the user is in the bedroom now. The next step should be to go east back to the kitchen and look for the lettuce there. But the original plan said the couch. Maybe there's a mistake in the game's setup, but the user has to proceed. So the correct next action is to go east to the kitchen again.

Okay, the user has been going in circles between the bedroom and kitchen, checking various items but not finding the lettuce. The original plan was to retrieve the lettuce from the couch, but it's not there. Maybe the lettuce was never actually in the bedroom, and the user needs to find it elsewhere. Since the kitchen island had a note, maybe the lettuce is on the stove or counter. But the user hasn't checked those places yet. Alternatively, the game might have a mistake, but the user needs to keep trying. The next step should be to go back to the kitchen and check the stove again, as the lettuce might be there.

Okay, the user is in the garden and needs to find the lettuce. They tried taking a tomato from the tomato plant but couldn't. The garden has a half-bag of chips, an apple, a tomato plant, and a shovel. The original goal was to retrieve the lettuce from the couch, but maybe the lettuce is here instead. The user might have misunderstood the location. Since the tomato plant is present, maybe the lettuce is elsewhere. The next step should be to check the other items, like the bag of chips or the apple. But the user needs to find the lettuce. Alternatively, maybe the lettuce is on the patio table in the kitchen. But the user is in the garden now. The correct action is to look at the other items available here. So, the next command should be to take the apple or check the bag of chips.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

There is an open wooden door leading east.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. An ordinary one.

You can see a closed chest drawer in the corner. You see an antique trunk. What a letdown! The antique trunk is empty! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a king-size bed. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open wooden door leading east.

go east
GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An usual kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You see a refrigerator. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is standard. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a stove. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. But the thing is empty.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.
