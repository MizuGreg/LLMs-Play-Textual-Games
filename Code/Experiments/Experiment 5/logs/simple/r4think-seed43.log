You are now playing a fast paced episode of TextWorld! First, it would be fantastic if you could make absolutely sure that the chest drawer is ajar. Then, take the old key from the chest drawer. After that, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door within the bedroom is opened. And then, make an attempt to head east. If you can get around to doing that, look and see that the refrigerator within the kitchen is open. Once you have opened the refrigerator, pick up the milk from the refrigerator inside the kitchen. If you can get your hands on the milk, place the milk on the stove inside the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal kind of place.

You see a closed chest drawer. You can make out a closed antique trunk right there by you. You can see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.

You make out a closed refrigerator. You see a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You can see a stove. The stove is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You move on, clearly angry about TextWorld. You can see a kitchen island. You wonder idly who left that here. You see a note on the kitchen island. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. Now they're in the kitchen, and the next step according to the original plan was to check if the refrigerator is open. But the refrigerator is closed here. The user's score is at 5/6, so they need to proceed to open the refrigerator.

Looking at the current scene in the kitchen, the refrigerator is closed. The user needs to open it. The next logical step would be to open the refrigerator. Once it's open, they need to pick up the milk from inside. Then place the milk on the stove. So the immediate action here is to open the refrigerator. The user's previous action was going east, which led them to the kitchen. Now, the next command should be to open the refrigerator. Let me check the available actions in the kitchen description. The user can interact with the refrigerator, which is closed. So the correct command is "open refrigerator".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps in the TextWorld game. They've already opened the refrigerator, taken the milk, and now they're trying to place the milk on the stove. The system responded that "place milk on stove" isn't a recognized verb. Hmm, maybe the correct command is different. Let me think about the possible actions here.

In TextWorld, commands are usually verbs that match the game's vocabulary. The user has the milk in hand. The next step is to put it on the stove. The correct command might be "put milk on stove" instead of "place". Let me check the previous interactions. The user said "place milk on stove" and got an error. So maybe "put" is the right verb here. Let me confirm that. Yes, "put" is a common verb for placing items. So the next action should be "put milk on stove".
