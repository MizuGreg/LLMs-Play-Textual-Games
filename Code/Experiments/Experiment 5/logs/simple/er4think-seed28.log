Welcome to TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, doublecheck that the chest drawer is opened. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. After that, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. After that, open the wooden door. And then, travel east. Once you manage that, open the refrigerator within the kitchen. Then, recover the bell pepper from the refrigerator. If you have picked up the bell pepper, place the bell pepper on the stove inside the kitchen. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just sauntered into a bedroom.

You make out a closed chest drawer nearby. You make out a closed antique trunk, which looks standard, nearby. You can make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. What's the point of an empty king-size bed?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld. The goal is to follow a series of steps to reach the original goal, which I assume is something like escaping or completing a quest. The user has already opened the chest drawer and retrieved the old key, but there was a mistake in the command.

First, the user tried "retrieve old key from chest drawer," but the system said that's not a recognized verb. So I need to figure out the correct command. In text adventures, common verbs are like 'take', 'get', 'open', 'use', etc. Since the key is in the chest drawer, the correct action would be to take the key. The previous step was opening the chest drawer, which revealed the key. So the next step should be taking the key.

But the user might have confused "retrieve" with "take." So the correct command here is "take old key." Alternatively, maybe "get old key." But in the game's context, the correct verb might be "take." Let me check the previous interaction. The user said "retrieve old key from chest drawer," which the system rejected. So the correct action is probably "take old key" without the "from chest drawer" part, since the key is already in the chest drawer after opening it. So the next action should be taking the key.

Then, after taking the key, the next step is to unlock the wooden door with the old key. So the user needs to use the key on the door. The command would be "unlock wooden door with old key" or "use old key on wooden door." But the game might expect "unlock wooden door" after using the key. Wait, the original instructions said to check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. So maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" using the key. But the exact command depends on the game's syntax.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "use old key on wooden door" to unlock it. But the user's previous action was retrieving the key, so after that, the next step is to unlock the door. So the correct command here is "unlock wooden door" using the key. However, the system might require the player to use the key first. So the next action after taking the key is to unlock the door.

But the user's last action was "retrieve old key from chest drawer," which was invalid. The correct command should be "take old key." Then, after taking the key, the next step is to unlock the door. So the user needs to take the key first. Therefore, the correct next action is "take old key."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to progress through the game. They've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, but then tried to go east before opening the door. The game responded that they need to open the door first.

So the correct step here is to open the wooden door after unlocking it. Wait, but they already unlocked it. Maybe the game considers unlocking and opening as separate actions. Or maybe "unlock" is enough, and then they can go through the door. But the game says they have to open it first. So perhaps after unlocking, they need to open the door. But the user tried to go east before opening, which was incorrect.

The next action should be to open the wooden door. So the command would be "open wooden door". Then, after that, they can go east. So the correct next step is to open the door first.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can make out a refrigerator. You see a counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You scan the room, seeing a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, the user is trying to place the bell pepper on the stove. They tried "place bell pepper on stove," but the game said that's not a recognized verb. Hmm, in text adventures, the commands are usually more straightforward. Instead of "place," maybe they need to "put" the bell pepper on the stove. Let me check the previous actions. The user took the bell pepper from the refrigerator, so the next step is to put it on the stove. The correct command might be "put bell pepper on stove." Alternatively, maybe "put bell pepper into stove" or "put bell pepper on the stove." The game might expect "put" instead of "place." So the next action should be "put bell pepper on stove."
