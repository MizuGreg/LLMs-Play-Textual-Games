Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to doublecheck that the antique trunk is opened. Then, recover the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. Having taken the old key, insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it. After that, look and see that the wooden door is ajar. And then, travel east. With that over with, ensure that the screen door is open. And then, attempt to move east. After that, make an attempt to go south. With that accomplished, lift the apple from the floor of the garden. After that, make an attempt to take a trip north. Then, go to the west. With that over with, put the apple on the stove. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An ordinary one.

Oh, great. Here's a chest drawer. You make out an antique trunk. Huh, weird. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what the next step should be. The user is in the Backyard, and they need to follow the previous instructions. The original goal was to lift the apple from the garden and then put it on the stove. So far, they've gone through the bedroom, kitchen, living room, bathroom, and backyard. 

In the Backyard, there's a patio table mentioned. The user needs to go to the garden to get the apple. But the current location is the Backyard. The instructions said after moving east from the kitchen, they should go to the garden. Wait, maybe the garden is part of the backyard? Or perhaps there's a different path.

Looking at the Backyard description, there's a patio table and a bbq, but no mention of a garden. However, the user needs to lift the apple from the garden. So maybe the garden is adjacent to the backyard. The user needs to find the garden, get the apple, then go back to the kitchen or another area to put it on the stove.

But the current location is the Backyard. The next step might be to go south, as the Backyard has an unguarded exit to the south. If they go south, maybe they reach the garden. Alternatively, maybe the garden is in the kitchen or another room. Wait, the user was supposed to go east from the kitchen to the backyard, then maybe the garden is south of the backyard.

So the next action should be to go south from the Backyard to reach the garden where the apple is. Then lift the apple. After that, they need to go back to the kitchen or another area to put the apple on the stove. But the user's current step is in the Backyard, so going south seems logical. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user was in the Kitchen, went east to the Backyard. Now, in the Backyard, the exit to the south is unguarded. So going south would be the next step to reach the garden. Therefore, the correct command is "go south".

-= Garden =-
You are in a garden. A standard one.

There is a tomato plant, a milk, an apple and a shovel on the floor.

Okay, the user is trying to take the apple from the floor in the Garden, but the game keeps saying "You can't see any such thing." Let me check the previous messages.

In the Garden description, it says: "There is a tomato plant, a milk, an apple and a shovel on the floor." So the apple is indeed there. But the user is trying to take it, and the game isn't recognizing it. Maybe the correct command is "take apple" instead of "take apple from floor"? Or perhaps the game expects a different phrasing. The user has been using "take apple from floor" multiple times, but it's not working. Maybe the apple is just on the floor, so the command should be "take apple". Let me try that. If the game allows that, then the user can pick it up. Alternatively, maybe the game is case-sensitive, so "Apple" with a capital letter? But the user has been using lowercase. Hmm. The correct action here is to take the apple, so the next step should be "take apple".

Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You can see a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

You've just sauntered into a bathroom.

You can see a closed toilet. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a bath. Hmm. You always thought you'd be more excited to see a bath in a room. You make out a sink. The sink is normal. On the sink you see a toothbrush.

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

You are in a living room. An usual one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a couch. The couch is ordinary. On the couch you can see a bell pepper. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a low table. The low table is typical. On the low table you make out a remote. You can make out a tv. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly upset with TextWorld.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been moving around the house a lot, going back and forth between rooms. The main goal was to lift the apple from the garden and put it on the stove. They successfully took the apple from the garden earlier, but now they're back in the kitchen again.

The current location is the kitchen. The user needs to go to the stove, which is mentioned in the kitchen description. The stove is supposed to be empty, but the user has the apple. The next step should be to go to the stove and put the apple on it. However, the user hasn't done that yet. 

Looking at the previous steps, after taking the apple, they went back to the kitchen, then moved around between rooms. Now, they need to find the stove and put the apple there. The kitchen has a stove, so the command should be "go to stove" or "go to the stove". But in the game's context, maybe the correct command is "go to stove" or "go to the stove". Alternatively, since the user is already in the kitchen, they might need to use "go to stove" to reach it. 

Wait, in the kitchen description, it says "You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty." So the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is present. The next action should be to go to the stove and put the apple there. The correct command would be "go to stove" or "go to the stove". But the game might expect a specific phrasing. Since the user has the apple, they need to put it on the stove. So the next step is to go to the stove and then put the apple there. But the user is already in the kitchen, so maybe "go to stove" is the next command.

<think>
Okay, the user is stuck in the kitchen, trying to find the stove. They've tried "go to stove" multiple times, but the game says "You can't see any such thing." Let me check the previous messages.

In the Kitchen description, it says: "You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty." So the stove is present. Maybe the correct command is just "go to stove" or "go to the stove". But the user has been typing "go to stove" and it's not working. Wait, maybe the game expects a different verb, like "go to" followed by the direction or item. Alternatively, maybe the stove is in a specific location that requires moving in a certain direction.

Looking at the kitchen's exits: there's an open screen door east and an open wooden door west. The user is in the kitchen, so maybe the stove is in the same room, and the problem is that the user isn't moving towards it. But the user is already in the kitchen. Wait, maybe the stove is not visible from where the user is, so they need to move to a different part of the kitchen. The kitchen island is mentioned, so maybe the user needs to go to the kitchen island first. The note on the kitchen island might be a clue. But the user's goal is to put the apple on the stove, so perhaps they need to go to the stove's location.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "go to stove" but the game is case-sensitive. Maybe it's "stove" with a capital S. Or maybe the command should be "go to the stove". The user has tried "go to stove" multiple times, but the game isn't recognizing it. Maybe the game expects "go to stove" without the "the". Let me check the previous interactions. The user has been using "go to stove" and it's not working. Maybe the correct command is "go to stove" but the game is not processing it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use a different verb, like "approach stove" or "go to stove".

Alternatively, maybe the stove is not in the kitchen but in another room. Wait, no, the kitchen description says the stove is there. The user has the apple, so they need to put it on the stove. The problem is that the game isn't recognizing the stove. Maybe the correct command is "put apple on stove" but the user hasn't done that yet. Wait, the user has the apple, so they need to put it on the stove. But the user is in the kitchen, so the next step is to go to the stove and then put the apple there. But the game is not allowing "go to stove". Maybe the correct command is "go to stove" but the game is case-sensitive. Let me try "go to stove" again. If that doesn't work, maybe the user needs to use "go to the stove". Alternatively, maybe the stove is in a different part of the kitchen, and the user needs to move towards it. But the user is already in the kitchen. This is confusing. The user needs to put the apple on the stove, but the game isn't recognizing the stove. Maybe the correct command is "put apple on stove" directly. Let me check if that's possible. The user has the apple, so they can try "put apple on stove". But the game might require being in the same room as the stove. Since the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is there, maybe "put apple on stove" is the correct command. Let me try that.
