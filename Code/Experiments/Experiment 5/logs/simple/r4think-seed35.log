Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to open the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. With the old key, insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. After that, ensure that the wooden door is open. Then, try to go east. After that, open the refrigerator. After that, recover the tomato plant from the refrigerator. If you can get your hands on the tomato plant, sit the tomato plant on the stove in the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An usual kind of place.

A closed chest drawer is in the room. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an antique trunk. Huh, weird. What's that over there? It looks like it's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let me see. The user is playing this text-based game and has reached the point where they've unlocked the wooden door. The original goal was to open the chest drawer, get the old key, unlock the door, go east, open the fridge, get the tomato plant, put it on the stove, and then stop.

So far, they've done the first three steps: opened the chest drawer, took the key, and unlocked the door. The next step according to the instructions was to "ensure that the wooden door is open," which they've done. Then they needed to "try to go east." The user's last action was unlocking the door, so the next logical step is to go east. 

The user's previous attempt to "insert old key into wooden door's lock" was corrected to "unlock wooden door with old key," which worked. Now, after unlocking, the next command should be "go east." The user needs to move east from the bedroom through the unlocked door. 

The user's current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door leading east is now open. So the next action is to go east. The user hasn't done that yet, so the correct command here is "go east." The user's score is at 3/4, so they're halfway there. They need to proceed to the next rooms, open the fridge, get the tomato plant, etc. 

I need to make sure the command is correct. The user has to go east from the current room (bedroom) through the unlocked door. So the next action is definitely "go east."

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game. The current scenario is in the bedroom. They've already opened the chest drawer, retrieved the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and tried to go east. But the game says they have to open the wooden door first. Wait, but they just unlocked it. Maybe the door is locked from the outside? Or maybe "unlock" doesn't mean the same as "open" here. The user tried to go east but couldn't because the door was still closed. So even though they unlocked it, maybe they need to open it fully.

The next step would be to open the door. The previous action was trying to go east, which failed because the door was closed. So the correct action now is to open the wooden door. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "unlock wooden door with old key" which worked, but the door might still be locked. Wait, maybe the game uses "unlock" to mean making it possible to open, but the actual action is to open it. So after unlocking, they need to open the door. So the next command should be "open wooden door". That makes sense. The user needs to open the door after unlocking it. So the next action is to open the door.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a refrigerator. You make out a counter. The counter is standard. The counter appears to be empty. You make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove! oh well. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to complete the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the door, went east into the kitchen. Now they're in the kitchen, opened the refrigerator and found a tomato plant and chips.

The next step according to the original task was to recover the tomato plant from the refrigerator, then sit it on the stove in the kitchen. The user just opened the fridge and found the tomato plant, so the next logical step is to take the tomato plant. Then, they need to put it on the stove. But the command needs to be in the correct format. The user has to first take the tomato plant, then put it on the stove. Since the current location is the kitchen, the commands would be "take tomato plant from refrigerator" and then "put tomato plant on stove". But the user's last action was opening the refrigerator, so the next step is to take the tomato plant. The assistant should output "take tomato plant from refrigerator" as the next command.
