-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom.

You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a chest drawer! You make out a closed antique trunk in the room. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The player is trying to get the tomato plant from the fridge, but first they need to open the door. They tried pushing and pulling the wooden door, but it's fixed. Maybe the door is locked from the outside? Wait, the user already unlocked it with the key. Hmm. Maybe the door is jammed? Or perhaps they need to find another way to open it. Wait, the original goal was to open the door, then go east, then open the fridge, get the tomato plant, put it on the stove, and win. So maybe after unlocking, they need to open it fully. But the game says "push wooden door" and "pull wooden door" but it's fixed. Maybe the correct action is to "open wooden door" instead? But the user tried pushing and pulling. Alternatively, maybe the door is already unlocked but needs to be pushed open. Wait, the user tried pushing and pulling, but it's fixed. Maybe the door is stuck, so they need to find another way. Wait, maybe the key was used to unlock, but the door is still closed. Maybe the next step is to try opening it again. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go east first. Wait, the original instructions said after unlocking, check that the door is unlocked and then see if it's ajar. But the user is stuck on pushing and pulling. Maybe the correct action is to "open wooden door" even though the game says it's fixed. Or maybe the user needs to try another command. Alternatively, maybe the door is already open, but the game is not reflecting that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look for another way. But according to the problem, the user is supposed to try to head east after the door is unlocked and ajar. But the user is stuck on the door. Maybe the correct next step is to try "open wooden door" again, even though the game says it's fixed. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find another way. But the game's response says "It is fixed in place." So maybe the door can't be pushed or pulled. Maybe the correct action is to "open wooden door" instead. But the user tried pushing and pulling. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find another object to use. But the current room has the chest drawer, the wooden door, the bed, and the fridge. Wait, the user hasn't opened the fridge yet. Maybe the user needs to go east first. But the door is fixed. Hmm. Maybe the user is supposed to try "open wooden door" again. Let me check the previous steps. The user unlocked the door, but it's still fixed. Maybe the correct action is to "open wooden door" even though the game says it's fixed. Or maybe the user needs to try "push wooden door" again. But the game says it's fixed. Maybe the user is supposed to try "open wooden door" now. So the next action would be "open wooden door".

-= Kitchen =-
You're now in the kitchen.

You make out a refrigerator. You make out a counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've managed to open the chest drawer, take the old key, unlock and open the wooden door in the bedroom, then go east to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, they opened the refrigerator and found a bell pepper and a tomato plant.

The next step according to the original plan was to recover the tomato plant from the refrigerator. Since they just opened the fridge and found the tomato plant inside, the next logical action would be to take it. Then they need to rest the tomato plant on the stove. So after taking the tomato plant, they should go to the stove and place it there. Once that's done, they win.

But let's check the current state. The user just opened the refrigerator, so the next command should be to take the tomato plant. Then, they need to go to the stove, which is in the kitchen. So the steps are: take tomato plant, then go to stove, then put it there. The user's last action was opening the fridge, so the immediate next step is to take the tomato plant. The assistant should respond with "take tomato plant".
