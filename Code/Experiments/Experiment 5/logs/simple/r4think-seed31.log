You are now playing a life changing game of TextWorld! First stop, open the antique trunk. After pulling open the antique trunk, take the old key from the antique trunk within the bedroom. If you can get your hands on the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. And then, look and see that the wooden door is ajar. After that, try to go east. Then, try to move south. After that, retrieve the lettuce from the couch. And then, try to head north. Then, place the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. An ordinary one.

You can see a closed chest drawer in the corner. You see an antique trunk. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a king-size bed. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game. They started by opening the antique trunk, taking the old key, unlocking the wooden door, and now they're at the door. The next step according to the original instructions was to "look and see that the wooden door is ajar." But since the door was already unlocked, maybe the next action is to check if it's open. However, the user might need to "look" at the door to confirm it's ajar. But the game's response after unlocking the door might have already indicated that it's open. Wait, the user's last action was unlocking the door, and the score increased. Now, the next step in the original plan was to "try to go east." But the user needs to check if the door is ajar first. However, the game's current state might have the door open after unlocking. So the next action should be to go east. But the user needs to make sure the door is open. Alternatively, maybe the door is now open, so they can proceed. The user's next action should be to go east. Let me check the original instructions again. After unlocking the door, the next step was to "look and see that the wooden door is ajar." So maybe the user needs to look at the door to confirm. But in the game, after unlocking, the door might be open. So the next action would be to go east. But the user's last action was unlocking the door, and the next step is to go east. So the correct command is "go east."

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. They've already unlocked the wooden door with the old key, but when they tried to go east, the game said they had to open the door first. Wait, but they just unlocked it. Maybe the door is still closed? Or maybe "unlock" doesn't mean "open" in this game's terminology. The user might have misunderstood the action.

Looking back at the previous steps: They opened the antique trunk, took the key, then unlocked the wooden door. The game's response was "You unlock wooden door." But maybe the door is still closed and needs to be opened. The user then tried to go east, but the game said they had to open the door first. So perhaps the correct action is to open the door, not just unlock it. But the game's feedback after unlocking was that the door is now unlocked. Hmm, maybe the user needs to open it instead of unlocking. But the game's rules might be different. 

Alternatively, maybe the door is locked and requires unlocking, but once unlocked, it's already open. But the user tried to go east before opening it, which the game corrected. So the next step should be to open the door. But the user already unlocked it. Wait, maybe "unlock" and "open" are different actions here. The user might need to open the door after unlocking. But the game's message after unlocking was that the door is now unlocked. So perhaps the door is open, but the game's message is confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to open the door again. But the game's message says "You unlock wooden door." So maybe the door is now open. But when the user tried to go east, the game said they had to open the door first. That's conflicting. Maybe the user needs to open the door again. But how? The correct action here is to open the door. But the user already unlocked it. Maybe the game's terminology is off. 

In any case, the user's next action should be to open the door. But the user already tried to go east and was told to open the door. So the correct action is to open the door. But how? The user has the key, so maybe they need to use it again. Wait, but they already unlocked it. Maybe the door is still closed, and "unlock" doesn't mean "open". So the user needs to open the door. The correct command would be "open wooden door". But the user tried to go east and was told to open it. So the next step is to open the door. Therefore, the next action is "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and then tried to go east but had to open the door first. They successfully opened the door, and now the score is at 4/6.

The next step in the original instructions was to "try to go east" after unlocking the door. Since the user just opened the door, the next logical step would be to go east. But wait, the user might need to check if the door is indeed open and if they can move through it. However, in the game's context, after unlocking and opening the door, moving east should be possible. The user's previous action was opening the door, so the next command should be "go east" again to proceed. The user needs to follow each step carefully as the game might have specific requirements. Let me make sure there's no mistake here. The original plan was after unlocking the door, go east, then south, retrieve lettuce, etc. So yes, "go east" is the next correct action.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An usual kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You see a refrigerator. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is standard. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a stove. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Wow! Just like in the movies!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen now. The original goal was to retrieve the lettuce from the couch, place it on the stove in the kitchen, and then win. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the key, unlocked the door, and went east to the kitchen. The kitchen has a note on the island, but the user hasn't found the lettuce yet.

Wait, the current location is the kitchen. The user needs to retrieve the lettuce from the couch. But the couch is in the bedroom, right? Wait, the original instructions said to retrieve the lettuce from the couch after moving east and then moving south. Wait, maybe the couch is in the kitchen now? Let me check the description again.

Looking at the Kitchen description: "You see a refrigerator, a counter, a stove, a kitchen island with a note." There's no mention of a couch here. The original plan was to go east (which led to the kitchen), then move south. But the user is now in the kitchen. Maybe the couch is in another room, like the bedroom? But the user just came from the bedroom through the east door. Wait, the initial steps were: open trunk, take key, unlock door, go east (to kitchen), then move south. But the user is in the kitchen now. Maybe the next step is to move south from the kitchen to reach the couch in another room. Alternatively, maybe the lettuce is on the kitchen island or somewhere else here.

Wait, the original instructions said: after unlocking the door and going east, then try to move south. Then retrieve the lettuce from the couch. So perhaps the couch is in a room south of the kitchen. But the current room is the kitchen. The user needs to go south from the kitchen. The kitchen has a screen door east, open wooden door west, and unguarded north and unblocked south. So moving south from the kitchen would take them to another room, maybe the bedroom again? Or another room with the couch.

But the user's next action should be to move south. Let me check the previous steps. The user was in the bedroom, unlocked the door, went east to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the next step is to move south. So the command should be "go south". That would take them to the next room, possibly where the couch is. Then they can retrieve the lettuce from the couch. Then place it on the stove. So the next action is "go south".

-= Living Room =-
You've just walked into a living room. You begin looking for stuff.

You can see a couch. The couch is typical. On the couch you see a lettuce. You can see a low table. The low table is normal. On the low table you can see a remote. You can see a tv. The tv is standard. The tv appears to be empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

But the current location is the living room. So the next action should be to take the lettuce from the couch. The user hasn't done that yet. The score is at 6/8, so they need to continue following the steps. The answer should be "take the lettuce from the couch".
