Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, open the chest drawer. Then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After pulling open the wooden door, take a trip east. And then, make sure that the screen door is wide open. After that, make an effort to move east. With that done, attempt to take a trip south. Then, pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. And then, attempt to go to the north. If you can succeed at that, make an effort to take a trip west. And then, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a chest drawer. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a closed antique trunk close by. Look over there! a king-size bed. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial task. They started by opening the chest drawer, picking up the old key, unlocking the wooden door, and then opening it. Now they're at the fifth step, which was to move east after opening the door.

The current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door leading east is now open. The next step mentioned in the task was to "make sure that the screen door is wide open." Wait, the user hasn't encountered a screen door yet. Maybe after moving east, they'll find it. But the user's last action was opening the wooden door, so the next logical step is to move east. 

But the user's next action should be moving east. However, the user's previous action was opening the wooden door, which is east. So maybe after opening the door, they need to go through it. The instruction says "after pulling open the wooden door, take a trip east." So perhaps the next step is to move east. 

But the user is in the bedroom, and the wooden door is open. So the next command should be "go east" or "move east." The user's previous action was "open the wooden door," so the next step is to go through it. The game's current state shows the bedroom with the open door. So the correct next action is to go east. 

The user's next action should be "go east." That's the next step in the task. The user has completed up to step 4 (opening the door), and the next step is moving east. So the answer is "go east."

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.

You see a refrigerator. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the refrigerator. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. You wonder idly who left that here. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

You've entered a backyard. You can barely contain your excitement.

You scan the room for a set of chairs, and you find a set of chairs! The set of chairs is typical. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? What's that over there? It looks like it's a bbq. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a bbq, go to TextWorld. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. You can see a patio table. The patio table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial task. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. They opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden where they picked up the bell pepper. Now they're back in the backyard after going north again.

The original goal was to pick up the bell pepper in the garden and then rest it on the stove. The user has already done the first part: picking up the bell pepper in the garden. The next step mentioned was attempting to go north, which they did, but now they're back in the backyard. The next action should be to go south back to the garden to rest the bell pepper on the stove. However, the current location is the backyard, so the correct command would be to go south to return to the garden. Once there, they can rest the bell pepper on the stove. But according to the last interaction, after picking up the bell pepper in the garden, they went north to the backyard. Now, they need to go south back to the garden to complete the task. The next action should be 'go south' to reach the garden again, then 'rest the bell pepper on the stove'.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to put the bell pepper on the stove, but the game says they can't see any such thing. Hmm. So, maybe the stove isn't in the current location. Let me check the previous locations.

The user was in the Garden, and the description mentions a half of a bag of chips, an apple, and a shovel on the floor. There's no mention of a stove here. Earlier, in the Kitchen, there was a stove, but the user moved to the Garden. So, maybe the stove is in the Kitchen, and the user is now in the Garden. Therefore, trying to put the bell pepper on the stove in the Garden is impossible because the stove isn't there.

The user's goal was to rest the bell pepper on the stove. So, perhaps they need to go back to the Kitchen where the stove is. But the current location is the Garden. The Garden has an exit to the north (Backyard) and south (probably back to the Kitchen? Wait, the Garden's description says "You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked." So going north from the Garden would take them back to the Backyard. But the Kitchen is probably accessible from the Backyard via the screen door. Wait, earlier in the Backyard, there's an open screen door leading west, which might lead back to the Kitchen. So the user needs to go from Garden to Backyard, then through the screen door to the Kitchen, then put the bell pepper on the stove there.

But the user is currently in the Garden. The next step would be to go north to the Backyard, then west through the screen door to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, the stove is present. So the correct sequence is to go back to the Kitchen, then put the bell pepper on the stove. However, the user is stuck in the Garden, trying to put it on the stove, which isn't there. So the correct action now is to go north to the Backyard, then west to the Kitchen, then put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user's last action was in the Garden, so the next command should be "go north" to reach the Backyard. Then, from there, "go west" to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, "put the bell pepper on the stove". But the user hasn't done that yet. So the current step is to go north to the Backyard.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete the game's objectives. They've picked up the bell pepper and are trying to put it on the stove. But in the current Garden scene, there's no stove mentioned. The items on the floor are a half-bag of chips, an apple, and a shovel. The user has been trying to put the bell pepper on the stove multiple times, but it's not there.

So, maybe the stove is in a different location. The user has been moving around: from the Bedroom to Kitchen, Backyard, and Garden. The stove was mentioned in the Kitchen scene. Wait, in the Kitchen, there's a stove, but when the user was there, they couldn't see anything on it. But the user is now in the Garden. Maybe they need to go back to the Kitchen to put the bell pepper on the stove there. However, the game's goal says to rest the bell pepper on the stove. If the stove is in the Kitchen, perhaps the user needs to go back there.

But the user is currently in the Garden. The last action was trying to put the bell pepper on the stove, which isn't present here. So the next step should be to go back to the Kitchen where the stove is. The user has to move north to get back to the Kitchen. Then, they can put the bell pepper on the stove there. But the user is stuck in the Garden, so the correct action is to go north to the Kitchen again. Then, once there, they can put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next command should be to go north to the Kitchen.

-= Backyard =-
You've entered a backyard. You can barely contain your excitement.

You scan the room for a set of chairs, and you find a set of chairs! The set of chairs is typical. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? What's that over there? It looks like it's a bbq. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a bbq, go to TextWorld. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. You can see a patio table. The patio table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

But in the current Garden scene, the description mentions a half of a bag of chips, an apple, and a shovel on the floor. There's no mention of a stove here. Earlier, in the Kitchen, there was a stove, but the user went to the Garden. So maybe the stove is in the Kitchen, and the user is in the Garden now. The problem is that the user is trying to put the bell pepper on the stove, but since they're in the Garden, the stove isn't visible. The correct action would be to go back to the Kitchen where the stove is located. So the next step should be to go north back to the Kitchen. Then, once there, they can put the bell pepper on the stove. But according to the last interaction, the user is in the Garden again. So the correct command here is to go north to the Kitchen.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete a series of tasks in this text-based game. They've successfully opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden. In the garden, they picked up the bell pepper.

The next step in the original goal was to "rest the bell pepper on the stove." But in the garden, there's no stove mentioned. The user has been trying to put the bell pepper on the stove, but it's not there. So maybe the stove is in another location, like the kitchen. But the user is currently in the garden. 

Wait, the user just tried to put the bell pepper on the stove again, but it's not visible. The garden has a half-bag of chips, an apple, and a shovel. No stove. So maybe the stove is in the kitchen. But the user is in the garden. They need to go back to the kitchen. But the original path was garden -> backyard -> kitchen -> backyard -> garden. Maybe the stove is in the kitchen. But the user hasn't been there since the kitchen was part of the earlier steps.

Alternatively, maybe the stove is in the backyard. But the backyard description doesn't mention a stove. The kitchen has a stove, but the user is in the garden. So the correct action would be to go back to the kitchen, then put the bell pepper on the stove there. But the user is currently in the garden. So the next step is to go north back to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is stuck in the garden trying to put it on the stove, which isn't there. So the correct action is to go back to the kitchen where the stove is. But the user's last action was in the garden. So the next step is to go north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the current problem is that the user is in the garden, trying to put the bell pepper on a stove that isn't there. Therefore, the next action should be to go back to the kitchen where the stove is located. So the correct command would be to go north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. But the user is in the garden, so the immediate next step is to go north to the backyard. Then, from the backyard, go west to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is in the garden, so the next action is to go north to the backyard. Therefore, the answer should be "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the Garden scene, trying to put the bell pepper on the stove. But the game says they can't see any such thing. Hmm, maybe the stove isn't in the Garden. Let me check the previous locations.

Earlier, the user went through the bedroom, kitchen, backyard, and garden. In the Garden, the description mentions a half-bag of chips, an apple, and a shovel on the floor. There's no mention of a stove here. The stove was in the kitchen, but when they were in the kitchen, they couldn't see anything on the stove. Wait, maybe the stove is in the kitchen, but the user is in the garden now. So putting the bell pepper on the stove is impossible because the stove isn't here.

The user's goal was to rest the bell pepper on the stove. But since the stove isn't in the garden, they need to go back to the kitchen. However, the user has been moving between locations, but maybe they didn't check the kitchen again. Alternatively, maybe the stove is in another location. But according to the game's descriptions, the stove is in the kitchen. So the user needs to go back to the kitchen to put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is in the garden now. So the next step would be to go north back to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. But the user's last action was going south to the garden again. So perhaps the user needs to go back to the kitchen. But the current location is the garden, so the correct action would be to go north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. However, the user might not have the stove in the kitchen anymore. Wait, in the kitchen, the description says there's a stove, but nothing on it.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the game, specifically in the Garden area. They've picked up the bell pepper and are trying to put it on the stove. But the game keeps saying they can't see a stove. Let me check the previous steps.

Earlier, they went through the bedroom, unlocked and opened the door, moved east to the Kitchen, then to the Backyard, and finally to the Garden. In the Garden, the description mentions a half-bag of chips, an apple, and a shovel on the floor. There's no mention of a stove here. The user is trying to put the bell pepper on the stove, but since there's no stove in the Garden, that's why it's not working.

Looking back at the Kitchen scene, there's a stove mentioned. But the user is currently in the Garden. So maybe they need to go back to the Kitchen to put the bell pepper on the stove there. However, the original goal was to rest the bell pepper on the stove. If the stove is in the Kitchen, perhaps the user needs to go back to the Kitchen after picking up the bell pepper in the Garden.

Wait, the user picked up the bell pepper in the Garden. So the next logical step would be to go back to the Kitchen where the stove is. But the user has been moving between the Garden and Backyard, but not back to the Kitchen. So the correct action would be to go north back to the Kitchen and then put the bell pepper on the stove there. However, the user is currently in the Garden, so the immediate next step is to go north to the Backyard again, then find the way back to the Kitchen. But the user might not realize that the stove is in the Kitchen and not in the Garden. Therefore, the correct action is to go back to the Kitchen and then put the bell pepper on the stove.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the Garden scene, trying to put the bell pepper on the stove. But the game says they can't see a stove. Let me check the previous steps.

The user has been moving through the rooms: Bedroom → Kitchen → Backyard → Garden. In the Garden, the items mentioned are a half-bag of chips, an apple, and a shovel. There's no mention of a stove here. The user tried to put the bell pepper on the stove, but since there's no stove in the Garden, that's why it's not working.

The original goal was to rest the bell pepper on the stove. But if the stove isn't in the current location (Garden), the user needs to find where the stove is. Maybe the stove is in the Kitchen? Let me check the Kitchen description again.

In the Kitchen, the user saw a refrigerator, a counter, a stove (but it wasn't mentioned as having anything on it). Wait, the Kitchen has a stove. So maybe the user needs to go back to the Kitchen and then put the bell pepper on the stove there.

But the user is currently in the Garden. The last action was going south from the Backyard to the Garden. So the next step would be to go back north to the Backyard, then west to the Kitchen, and then put the bell pepper on the stove there. However, the user's current location is the Garden, and they can't see the stove. So the correct action would be to go back to the Kitchen where the stove is located.

But the user's last command was "put the bell pepper on the stove", which failed. So the next step is to move to the Kitchen. The user needs to go north from the Garden to the Backyard, then west to the Kitchen. Once in the Kitchen, they can put the bell pepper on the stove.

But the user is in the Garden, so the immediate next action should be to go north to the Backyard. Then, from the Backyard, go west to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, put the bell pepper on the stove. However, the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next step is to go north to the Backyard.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the game, repeatedly trying to put the bell pepper on the stove but can't because the stove isn't visible. They've been moving between rooms, but the main issue is the lack of a stove in the Garden area. The original goal required resting the bell pepper on the stove, but since the stove isn't there, the player can't complete that step. The game's environment might not have a stove in the Garden, so the player needs to find another way or maybe the stove is in a different location. However, based on the current description of the Garden, there's no mention of a stove. The player might have to check other areas or maybe the stove is in the Kitchen. But the player is in the Garden now. Since the stove isn't present, the only way forward is to maybe go back to the Kitchen where the stove might be. But the user hasn't tried that yet. Alternatively, maybe the stove is part of the patio table or another object, but the description doesn't mention it. The player needs to figure out where the stove is. Since the user is stuck, the next logical step is to go back to the Kitchen where the stove is likely located. So the correct action would be to go north back to the Kitchen.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete a series of tasks in this text-based game. They've already picked up the bell pepper and are trying to put it on the stove. But in the current scene, the Garden room doesn't mention a stove. The user has been trying to "put the bell pepper on the stove" repeatedly, but the game keeps saying they can't see a stove. 

So, maybe the stove is in a different location. The user has been moving between rooms: Bedroom → Kitchen → Backyard → Garden. The stove was mentioned in the Kitchen scene. Wait, in the Kitchen, there's a stove, but the user didn't interact with it yet. However, the task was to rest the bell pepper on the stove after going through all the previous steps.

But the user is currently in the Garden, and the stove isn't there. So perhaps they need to go back to the Kitchen to put the bell pepper on the stove. However, the user's last action was going south to the Garden, and they're stuck because the stove isn't visible here. 

The original goal included picking up the bell pepper from the garden and then putting it on the stove. Since the stove isn't in the Garden, the user must have missed putting it on the stove in the Kitchen. But the user hasn't gone back to the Kitchen yet. So the next logical step is to go back to the Kitchen, put the bell pepper on the stove there, and then proceed with the remaining tasks.

But the user's current position is in the Garden. The available exits are north (to the Backyard) and south (back to the Garden, which doesn't help). Wait, the Garden's description says there's a half-bag of chips, an apple, and a shovel on the floor. No stove. So the user must have forgotten that the stove is in the Kitchen. Therefore, the correct action is to go back to the Kitchen, then put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. 

However, the user's last action was going south to the Garden, and they're stuck. So the next step should be to go north back to the Backyard, then west to the Kitchen, then put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user might not have the bell pepper with them if they left it in the Garden. Wait, no—the user picked up the bell pepper in the Garden and is holding it. So they need to go back to the Kitchen, where the stove is, and put it there. 

But the user is in the Garden, so the next step is to go north to the Backyard, then west to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, they can put the bell pepper on the stove. However, the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct next action is to go back to the Kitchen. But the user is currently in the Garden, so the immediate next step is to go north to the Backyard, then west to the Kitchen. But the user's current position is the Garden, so the first step is to go north to the Backyard. Then, from the Backyard, go west to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, put the bell pepper on the stove. 

But the user's last action was going south to the Garden, so they need to go north back to the Backyard. Then, from there, go west to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, put the bell pepper on the stove. That would complete the task. So the next command should be "go north" to return to the Backyard, then "go west" to the Kitchen, then "put the bell pepper on the stove".

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the Garden scene, trying to put the bell pepper on the stove, but the stove isn't visible. They've tried multiple times and keep getting the same error. The goal was to rest the bell pepper on the stove. But in the current description of the Garden, there's no mention of a stove. The items present are a half-bag of chips, an apple, and a shovel. The user might have misunderstood the environment.

Wait, maybe the stove is in the Kitchen? Earlier, in the Kitchen scene, there was a stove mentioned. But the user is currently in the Garden. So perhaps they need to go back to the Kitchen to find the stove. But the original task said after picking up the bell pepper, they should attempt to go north, then west, and then rest the bell pepper on the stove. However, the stove isn't in the Garden. So maybe the user needs to go back to the Kitchen where the stove is located.

But the user is in the Garden, and the only way to get back is to go south to the Backyard, then west to the Kitchen. But the user has been going back and forth between Garden and Backyard.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the game, repeatedly trying to put the bell pepper on the stove but can't see the stove. They've been moving between rooms, but the key item is the bell pepper, which they picked up in the garden. The problem is that the stove isn't visible in the garden description. The user has been trying to go north and south between the garden and backyard, but the stove is probably in the kitchen or another room.

Wait, earlier in the kitchen, there was a stove mentioned. But the user hasn't gone back to the kitchen. The current location is the garden, and the stove isn't there. So maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen. But how? The garden has a north exit to the backyard, which connects back to the kitchen via the screen door. Wait, the user was in the garden, then went south to the garden again? Maybe there's a path back to the kitchen through the backyard. Let me check the previous steps.

The user was in the garden, then went south to the garden (maybe a loop?), but the stove is in the kitchen. The user needs to find the stove. Since the stove isn't in the garden, the user must go back to the kitchen. But how? The garden's north exit is to the backyard, which has a screen door west leading back to the kitchen. So the user needs to go from garden north to backyard, then west through the screen door to the kitchen. But the user is currently in the garden, so they need to go north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, the stove is there. So the correct sequence is: go north to backyard, then west to kitchen, then put the bell pepper on the stove.

Once in the kitchen, the stove should be visible, and the user can put the bell pepper on it. So the user needs to navigate back to the kitchen. The previous attempts to go north and south were just moving between the garden and backyard, but the user hasn't gone west from the backyard yet. So the next action should be to go north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. But the user is in the garden, so first, go north to the backyard. Then, from there, go west to the kitchen.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a bbq. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a bbq, go to TextWorld. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. You can see a patio table. The patio table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a TextWorld game, and their goal is to follow a series of steps to reach the end. They've been moving through different rooms: bedroom, kitchen, backyard, garden. The main task is to pick up the bell pepper and put it on the stove.

But in the garden, when they try to put the bell pepper on the stove, it says "You can't see any such thing." That's confusing because earlier in the garden, they saw the bell pepper on the floor. Wait, maybe the stove isn't in the garden. Let me check the previous descriptions.

Looking back, when they were in the garden, the description mentioned a half-bag of chips, an apple, and a shovel on the floor. There's no mention of a stove there. The stove was in the kitchen. So maybe the user is trying to put the bell pepper on the stove in the garden, but the stove isn't there. That's why it's not working.

The user has the bell pepper, but they need to go to the kitchen where the stove is. But they've been going back and forth between the garden and backyard. The problem is that the stove is in the kitchen, which they've already passed through earlier. Maybe they need to go back to the kitchen to put the bell pepper on the stove.

But the user's last action was trying to put it in the garden, which isn't possible. So the correct step would be to go back to the kitchen. However, the user's current location is the garden, so they need to go north to the backyard, then maybe west to the kitchen? Wait, the kitchen was earlier in the path. Let me retrace the steps.

Original path: Bedroom -> Kitchen -> Backyard -> Garden. So from the garden, going north would take them back to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. But the user is stuck in the garden trying to put the bell pepper on the stove, which isn't there. So the correct action is to go back to the kitchen where the stove is located.

But the user's last command was "go north" which took them back to the backyard. Then they need to go west to the kitchen. But the user might not realize that the stove is in the kitchen. So the next step should be to go west from the backyard to the kitchen, then put the bell pepper on the stove there.

However, the user is in the garden, so they need to go north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. But the user's current location is the garden, so the next step is to go north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can put the bell pepper on the stove.

But the user's last action was "go north" which took them to the backyard. Then, they need to go west to the kitchen. So the next command should be "go west" from the backyard to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, they can put the bell pepper on the stove.

But the user is in the garden, so the correct sequence is: go north to backyard, then west to kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, put the bell pepper on the stove. However, the user hasn't been to the kitchen in a while, so they might need to retrace their steps.

Alternatively, maybe the stove is in the garden, but the description didn't mention it. The user might have a misunderstanding. But according to the game's descriptions, the stove is in the kitchen. So the correct action is to go back to the kitchen and then put the bell pepper on the stove there.

So the next step after being in the garden is to go north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, put the bell pepper on the stove. That would complete the task.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.

You see a refrigerator. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the refrigerator. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. You wonder idly who left that here. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.
