Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, open the chest drawer. Then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After pulling open the wooden door, take a trip east. And then, make sure that the screen door is wide open. After that, make an effort to move east. With that done, attempt to take a trip south. Then, pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. And then, attempt to go to the north. If you can succeed at that, make an effort to take a trip west. And then, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a chest drawer. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a closed antique trunk close by. Look over there! a king-size bed. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game called TextWorld. Their task is to follow a series of steps to reach a goal. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, and the score is up to 2 out of 3. The next step according to the initial instructions was to assure that the wooden door is unlocked.

Wait, the user has the old key. The wooden door is closed, but they need to unlock it. Since they have the key, they should use it to unlock the door. The next action should be to unlock the door. But how? In text games, usually, you'd use the key on the door. So the command would be "unlock the wooden door" or "use the old key on the wooden door". But the game's commands might be more specific. Let me check the previous actions. The user was told to "assure that the wooden door is unlocked" after picking up the key. So the next step is to unlock it. The correct command here is likely "unlock the wooden door" or "use the old key on the wooden door". But since the user has the key, they need to use it on the door. So the next action should be "unlock the wooden door" using the key. But the game might require the exact phrase. Let me think. The user has the key, so they need to use it on the door. The correct command would be "use the old key on the wooden door" or "unlock the wooden door". But in the game's context, maybe "unlock the wooden door" is sufficient. However, since the key is in hand, the game might require using the key. So the next action is to unlock the door with the key. Therefore, the command should be "unlock the wooden door".

Okay, the user has opened the wooden door. The next step in the original task was to take a trip east. So after opening the door, they need to move east. The command would be "go east" or "move east". Since the door is leading east, the correct action is to go east.

But wait, the user is in the bedroom, and the door is leading east. So after opening the door, they should go through it. The command would be "go east". Let me check the previous actions.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.

You see a refrigerator. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the refrigerator. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. You wonder idly who left that here. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

You've entered a backyard. You can barely contain your excitement.

You scan the room for a set of chairs, and you find a set of chairs! The set of chairs is typical. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? What's that over there? It looks like it's a bbq. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a bbq, go to TextWorld. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. You can see a patio table. The patio table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, the user is in the backyard. The next step according to the original task was to "attempt to move east" after opening the screen door. But in the current location (backyard), the open screen door leads west. The user needs to move east, but there's no door mentioned here. Wait, the original instructions said after opening the screen door, try moving east. But in the backyard, the exit is west. Maybe there's another way. Let me check the current description. The backyard has a screen door west and a south exit. The user was told to "attempt to go to the north" after some steps. Wait, the original task said: "After that, attempt to go to the north. If you can succeed at that, make an effort to take a trip west." But the user is now in the backyard. Maybe the next step is to go south, as the description says "You should try going south." But according to the original task, after moving east from the kitchen, they should go south. Wait, the user's current location is the backyard. The original task said after moving east from the kitchen, then attempt to go south. But in the backyard, the possible directions are west (screen door) and south. So the next action should be to go south. But the user's score is 7/8, so they need to complete the steps. The next step in the original task was to "attempt to go to the north" after moving east. But maybe the user is supposed to go south here. Wait, the current location is the backyard, and the user was told to "attempt to go to the north" after some steps. But in the backyard, there's no north direction mentioned. The possible exits are west and south. So maybe the user needs to go south. But according to the original task, after moving east from the kitchen, they should go south. So the next action is to go south. But the user is in the backyard, and the description says "You should try going south." So the correct command is "go south".

I am so happy to announce that you are now in the garden. You begin to take stock of what's here.
