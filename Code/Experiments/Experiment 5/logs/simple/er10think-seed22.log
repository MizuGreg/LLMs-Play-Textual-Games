Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to open the chest drawer within the bedroom. After that, recover the old key from the chest drawer. Then, unlock the wooden door within the bedroom. And then, assure that the wooden door is ajar. After opening the wooden door, attempt to move east. Then, make sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is ajar. After pulling open the screen door, take a trip east. Following that, make an effort to venture south. With that accomplished, pick up the milk from the floor of the garden. Then, head north. Next, try to go west. With that accomplished, rest the milk on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A standard one.

Were you looking for a chest drawer? Because look over there, it's a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. Look over there! a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the bedroom trying to push the wooden door open. They've already unlocked it, but it's still closed. The problem is that the door is locked but they have the key. Wait, maybe they need to use the key again? But they already unlocked it. Hmm.

Wait, the previous steps: they opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door. Then tried to push it open but couldn't. The game says "That's unlocked at the moment." So maybe the door is unlocked but not open? So the next step should be to push it open. But the user tried that and got "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the door is not in a position where it can be pushed? Or maybe the action is to open it instead of push?

Alternatively, maybe the door is locked again after unlocking? But the game message says it's unlocked. Maybe the correct action is to open the door instead of pushing. Let me check the previous commands. The user tried "push wooden door open" but it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "open wooden door"?

Wait, the initial instruction said to "unlock the wooden door within the bedroom" and then "assure that the wooden door is ajar." So after unlocking, they need to open it. Maybe the correct action is "open wooden door" instead of pushing. Let me try that. The user might have used the wrong verb. So the next action should be "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to pick up the milk from the garden. The previous attempt was "take milk from floor" which didn't work, then "pick up milk from floor" which also didn't work. The game response was "I only understood you as far as wanting to pick up the milk." So maybe the correct command is just "take milk" or "pick up milk" without specifying "from floor" since the game might automatically recognize it's on the floor.

The user's goal is to pick up the milk from the floor of the garden. The current location is the garden, and the milk is on the floor. The correct action should be to take the milk. The previous attempts used "take milk from floor" and "pick up milk from floor", but maybe the game expects a simpler command. So the next action should be "take milk" or "pick up milk". Since the game's response indicated that the user's intent was understood, perhaps the correct command is just "take milk".

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the kitchen and bathroom. They keep going north and south, which is leading them back and forth. The original goal was to pick up the milk and then rest it on the stove. But the user already picked up the milk in the garden. The next step was to go north, but that's leading them to the bathroom again. Maybe they need to go west from the kitchen instead of north. The kitchen has an open wooden door leading west, which might be the way back to the bedroom or another area. Since the user is supposed to rest the milk on the stove, they need to be in the kitchen again. The correct path is to go west from the kitchen to the backyard, then north to the garden, but the user is getting stuck in the bathroom. So the next action should be to go west from the kitchen to exit the bathroom and return to the kitchen. The correct command is "go west".

Okay, the user is going in circles between the kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom. They need to rest the milk on the stove. The milk was picked up in the garden, so they need to be in the kitchen again. The last action was going north to the bathroom, then south back to the kitchen. The correct step is to go west from the kitchen to the backyard, then north to the garden, but the user is stuck in the bathroom loop. The next action should be to go west from the kitchen to exit the bathroom and return to the kitchen. But the user tried that and got "You can't go that way." So maybe they need to go south from the bathroom again. But the user is supposed to be in the kitchen. The correct path is to go west from the kitchen to the backyard, then north to the garden, but the user is stuck in the bathroom.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck in a loop between the kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom. They need to rest the milk on the stove. The milk was picked up in the garden, so they need to be in the kitchen again. The last action was going west from the kitchen, but they can't. The correct step is to go south from the bathroom to the kitchen. But the user is in the bathroom. The next action should be to go south from the bathroom to the kitchen. But the user is in the bathroom. So the correct command is "go south".
