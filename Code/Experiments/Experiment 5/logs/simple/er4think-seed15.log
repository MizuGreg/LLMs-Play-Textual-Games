It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, open the chest drawer. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. After picking up the old key, make it so that the wooden door is unlocked. After that, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. After that, move east. With that done, open the screen door. And then, go east. Following that, try to move south. Okay, and then, recover the apple from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the apple, head north. That done, try to head west. And then, put the apple on the stove in the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You see a chest drawer. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a closed antique trunk here. You see a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You swear loudly.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user has already opened the chest drawer and picked up the old key. The next step according to the original instructions was to unlock the wooden door. So, using the old key, they need to unlock the door. The current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door is closed. The next action should be to unlock it. The user has a key, so the command would be to unlock the door. Let me check the previous steps again. Yes, after picking up the key, the next step is to unlock the door. Then open it, move east, open the screen door, etc. So the next action is to unlock the wooden door.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You make out a closed refrigerator. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island! The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Huh, weird.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps correctly. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east into the kitchen. The next step according to the original plan was to open the screen door. The kitchen has a closed screen door leading east. So the next action should be to open that screen door. The user's score is now 5/6, so they're on the right track. The next command should be "open screen door".

You've entered a backyard.

You see a set of chairs. The set of chairs is ordinary. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You make out a bbq. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a patio table! The patio table is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is a milk, an apple, a lettuce and a shovel on the floor.

Okay, the user tried to say "recover apple" but the system said that's not a recognized verb. So I need to think of the correct command. The apple is on the floor, so maybe the right action is "take apple" or "pick up apple". Let me check the previous steps. The goal was to recover the apple from the floor of the garden. So the correct command should be "take apple" or "pick up apple". Since the user was in the garden and the apple is on the floor, "take apple" is the right action. Let me make sure that's the correct verb here. Yes, "take" is the correct verb for picking up items. So the next action should be "take apple".

Okay, let's see. The user has recovered the apple and went north, ending up back in the backyard. The original goal was to put the apple on the stove in the kitchen. So after picking up the apple, they needed to go back to the kitchen. But now they're in the backyard again. The next step should be to go west through the open screen door back to the kitchen. The user's score is 9/11, so they're close. The correct command is "go west".
