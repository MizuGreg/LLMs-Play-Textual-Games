You are now playing a profound session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, ensure that the antique trunk is open. And then, recover the old key from the antique trunk in the bedroom. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. Then, open the wooden door. And then, move east. And then, make absolutely sure that the screen door is open. Having opened the screen door, attempt to head east. With that done, move south. Then, retrieve the apple from the floor of the garden. And then, make an attempt to venture north. If you can succeed at that, head west. With that accomplished, sit the apple on the stove inside the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in a bedroom.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a chest drawer, so there's that. You make out a closed antique trunk in the corner. You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. The goal is to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the antique trunk and found an old key inside. But when they tried to "recover old key from antique trunk," the game didn't recognize that as a valid command.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is just "take old key" or "get old key" instead of "recover." Since the trunk is already open, the key is inside. The player needs to pick it up. The game's response was confused because "recover" isn't a standard verb here. So the next step should be to take the key from the trunk.

Wait, the user's previous action was "recover old key from antique trunk," which the game rejected. The correct action is probably "take old key" or "get old key." Let me check the game's possible commands. In TextWorld, common verbs are "take," "get," "use," "open," "close," etc. So the right command here is to take the key.

So the next action should be "take old key" or "get old key." But the user might have used "recover" instead of "take." So the correct command is "take old key." Let me make sure that's the right move. Once the key is taken, the next step is to unlock the wooden door with it. So after taking the key, the player should use it on the door.

Okay, let's see. The user has successfully opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door. The next step according to the original plan was to move east after opening the door. So the next action should be "go east". But wait, the user is in the bedroom, and after opening the wooden door leading east, they need to move into the next room. The game's current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door is open. So the correct command is "go east" to enter the next area. The user should then check the screen door and proceed as per the steps. So the next action is "go east".

You've just shown up in a kitchen.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a refrigerator. You make out a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You make out a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Living Room now. The goal is to retrieve the apple from the garden, then go north, west, sit the apple on the stove in the kitchen, and win. So far, they've opened the wooden door east from the bedroom, moved to the kitchen, went south to the living room. The next step according to the original plan was after opening the screen door and moving east, then move south. But in the current scenario, they're in the living room. The next step might be to check the north exit as mentioned in the game's description. The original plan said after moving east from the screen door, move south. But maybe the user needs to proceed north from here. Wait, the current location is the living room, and the game says there's an unblocked exit to the north. The original plan said after opening the screen door and moving east, then move south. But maybe the user is supposed to go north from the living room. Alternatively, maybe the apple is in the garden, so they need to go east through the screen door, then south to the garden. But the user is in the living room now. The next step should be to go north, as the game suggests, to continue the path towards the garden. So the correct command is "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Living Room again after going south from the kitchen. The goal is to retrieve the apple from the garden, then go north, west, sit the apple on the stove in the kitchen, and win. So far, they've moved between rooms but haven't found the apple yet. The next step should be to check the north exit again since the game mentioned it's unblocked. Maybe going north from the living room leads to the garden where the apple is. Alternatively, maybe they need to go east through the screen door to reach the garden. But in the previous steps, after opening the screen door, they went south and ended up back in the kitchen.
