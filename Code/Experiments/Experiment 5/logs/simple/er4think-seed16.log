I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, open the antique trunk. And then, retrieve the old key from the antique trunk. With the old key, unlock the wooden door inside the bedroom with the old key. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. And then, head east. After that, ensure that the screen door is open. And then, head east. And then, try to move south. And then, pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. With the bell pepper, attempt to head north. With that accomplished, go to the west. And then, place the bell pepper on the stove. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
Ah, the bedroom. This is some kind of bedroom, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can make out a closed chest drawer in the room. You can see a closed antique trunk nearby. You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game called TextWorld. Their task is to follow a series of steps to complete a quest. So far, they've opened an antique trunk and retrieved an old key. But the system gave an error saying "That's not a verb I recognise." Wait, maybe the user tried to "retrieve" the key, but the correct command is "take" or "get"?

Looking back at the previous interaction: the user said "retrieve the old key from the antique trunk", and the system responded with an error. So the system doesn't recognize "retrieve" as a valid verb. In text adventures, common verbs are "take", "get", "open", "use", etc. So the correct action here would be "take the old key" or "get the old key".

The user's next step after retrieving the key is to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with the old key. So after getting the key, they need to use it on the door. The next steps in the original task are: unlock the wooden door, ensure it's open, head east, open the screen door, head east again, move south, pick up the bell pepper, use it to head north, go west, and place the bell pepper on the stove.

But first, the user needs to correctly take the key. Since "retrieve" isn't a valid command, the correct action is "take" or "get". Let me check the game's possible commands. In many text adventures, "take" is the standard verb for picking up items. So the user should use "take the old key" next.

After that, they can use the key to unlock the door. The door is described as closed and leading east. So the next steps would be to use the key on the door, then open it. Then move east, etc.

So the correct next action is to take the key. The user's previous attempt was to "retrieve", which the system didn't recognize. So the answer should be "take the old key".

Okay, the user has successfully taken the old key from the trunk. Now, the next step according to the original task is to use the old key to unlock the wooden door inside the bedroom. The door is closed and leads east. So the next action should be to unlock the door with the key.

In text adventures, the command to unlock a door with a key is usually "use" followed by the key and the door. So the correct command here would be "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with old key". However, depending on the game's specific commands, it might be "unlock wooden door" if the key is already in hand.

Since the user has the key, the next step is to unlock the door. The system might accept "unlock wooden door" as the command. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "retrieve" which wasn't valid, but "take" worked. So "unlock" might be the next valid command here.

Therefore, the next action should be "unlock wooden door".

Okay, the user has unlocked the wooden door. The next step according to the task is to ensure the wooden door is open. Since they just unlocked it, maybe they need to check if it's open. But in the game, after unlocking, the door should automatically open. Then, the next action is to head east.

So the next command should be "go east" to move through the door. The user needs to move east, then open the screen door, head east again, move south, pick up the bell pepper, use it to go north, go west, and place the pepper on the stove. So after unlocking the door, the immediate next step is to go east.

Okay, the user tried to go east but the game said they have to open the wooden door first. Wait, but they just unlocked it. Maybe the door is locked again? Or maybe "unlock" isn't the correct command. Let me check the previous steps.

The user took the key and used it on the wooden door, which was closed. The game responded with "You unlock wooden door." So maybe the door is now open. But the system is saying they have to open it first. Maybe the command is "open wooden door" instead of "unlock"? Or perhaps the door is still considered locked even after unlocking.

Alternatively, maybe the game expects the player to use the key to open the door, so the correct command is "use old key on wooden door" again. But the user already did that. Hmm. The user's last action was "unlock wooden door", which the game accepted, but then the next prompt says they have to open it first. Maybe the game's parser is confused. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked and needs to be opened with the key. So the correct command is "open wooden door" instead of "unlock". Let me try that. So the next action should be "open wooden door".

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen now. The original task was to follow a series of steps. After opening the wooden door and going east, they're in the Kitchen. The next steps according to the original instructions were: after ensuring the wooden door is open, head east, then open the screen door, head east again, move south, pick up the bell pepper, use it to go north, go west, and place the pepper on the stove.

So in the Kitchen, the user needs to open the screen door leading east. The current room has a closed screen door east and an open wooden door west. The user's next action should be to open the screen door. The command would be "open screen door". Then, after opening it, they can go east again. Let me check if "open screen door" is the correct command here. The game's previous responses used "open" for doors, so that's likely the right verb. So the next action is to open the screen door.

Okay, the user is in the Garden now. The task was to pick up the bell pepper from the floor and use it to head north. The current room has a bell pepper on the floor. So the next step is to pick up the bell pepper. The command would be "pick up bell pepper" or "take bell pepper". Once picked up, the user needs to attempt to go north using the bell pepper. But according to the game's previous commands, after picking up the pepper, the next action is to try moving north. So first, pick up the bell pepper.

Looking at the previous interactions, the user was told to "pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. With the bell pepper, attempt to head north." So the correct sequence is pick up the bell pepper first, then go north. The user hasn't picked it up yet, so the next action is to take it.

Okay, the user picked up the bell pepper and tried to go north, which brought them back to the Backyard. The next step according to the original task was to go west after picking up the bell pepper. Wait, let me check the original steps again.

The original plan was: after picking up the bell pepper and attempting to head north, the user should go west and then place the bell pepper on the stove. But in the current scenario, after going north, they're back in the Backyard. The task says to "go to the west" after picking up the bell pepper. So maybe the next action is to go west from the Garden. But the user is now in the Backyard. Wait, maybe there's a confusion in the steps.

Wait, the original steps said: after picking up the bell pepper and attempting to head north, go west. But in the current state, the user is in the Backyard. The Backyard has an open screen door leading west. But the original task says to place the bell pepper on the stove. The stove is in the Kitchen, which was previously visited. Hmm, maybe the user needs to go back to the Kitchen and then to the stove.

But the current location is the Backyard. The user needs to go west from here, but the Backyard's west is the screen door leading back to the Kitchen. So the next action should be to go west to return to the Kitchen, then find the stove and place the bell pepper there. But according to the original steps, after picking up the bell pepper and going north (which brought them back to Backyard), the next step was to go west. So perhaps the correct next action is to go west from the Backyard. But the user is already in the Backyard. Wait, maybe the user needs to go west from the Garden after picking up the bell pepper. But the user is in the Backyard now. Maybe there's a mistake in the steps.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the Backyard to get back to the Kitchen, then place the bell pepper on the stove. So the next action is to go west. But the user is in the Backyard, and the screen door is leading west. So the command would be "go west" to return to the Kitchen.

The original goal was to place the bell pepper on the stove. The user has the bell pepper, but they're in the Bathroom. The stove is in the Kitchen, which is connected via the screen door east or the wooden door west. But the user is in the Bathroom, which is a different room. So maybe they need to find a way back to the Kitchen.

Okay, the user is in the Kitchen again and tried to "place bell pepper on stove", but the game says that's not a recognized verb. So I need to figure out the correct command to place the bell pepper on the stove.

In text adventures, placing an item on a surface usually involves using the "put" verb. So instead of "place", the correct command might be "put bell pepper on stove". Let me check previous interactions. The user had to "take" the bell pepper, then "go north", but in this case, they need to put it on the stove. So the correct command is "put bell pepper on stove". That should work.
