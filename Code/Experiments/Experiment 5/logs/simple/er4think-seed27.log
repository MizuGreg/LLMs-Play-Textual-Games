Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to look and see that the antique trunk is open. After that, pick up the old key from the antique trunk in the bedroom. After that, insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it. And then, ensure that the wooden door in the bedroom is open. After that, travel east. Okay, and then, doublecheck that the refrigerator is ajar. Then, take the milk from the refrigerator. Then, place the milk on the stove inside the kitchen. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You can see an antique trunk. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a king-size bed. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to complete objectives. The current challenge is about inserting a key into a wooden door to unlock it.

First, the user has already opened the antique trunk and taken the old key. The next step was to insert the key into the wooden door in the bedroom. The user tried "insert old key into wooden door," but the system responded that it's not a recognized verb. Then they tried "use old key on wooden door," which also didn't work. The system is probably expecting a different command format.

In text adventures, common verbs for interacting with objects include "use," "open," "close," "take," "put," "look," etc. Since the key is meant to unlock the door, the correct action might be "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with old key." However, the system might have a specific command structure. Maybe it's "use old key to unlock wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with old key."

Alternatively, the game might require a more direct approach. Since the door is described as "closed" and the key is needed to unlock it, the correct command could be "unlock wooden door" if the key is already in hand. But the user has the key, so they need to use it on the door.

The user's previous attempts were "insert old key into wooden door" and "use old key on wooden door," both of which didn't work. The system's response indicates that "use" might not be the right verb here. Maybe the correct verb is "unlock." So the next action should be "unlock wooden door" or "use old key to unlock wooden door."

But the user has the key, so maybe the correct command is "use old key on wooden door." However, the system said that's not a recognized verb. Maybe the game expects "unlock" as the verb. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user took the key from the trunk. The next step is to use the key on the door. The correct command might be "use old key on wooden door," but the system says it's not recognized. Maybe the game uses "unlock" as the verb. So the correct command is "unlock wooden door." Alternatively, "open wooden door" if the key is the correct one.

Alternatively, maybe the game requires "use old key to unlock wooden door." But the user's previous attempt was "use old key on wooden door," which didn't work. The system might be expecting "unlock" as the main verb. So the next action should be "unlock wooden door."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to progress in the game. They've opened the antique trunk, taken the key, and tried to unlock the door. The problem is that even though they've unlocked the door, the game is still prompting them to open it first. That's a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding. The user tried "unlock wooden door" and the system said it's already unlocked. But the game's message says they have to open the door first. So perhaps the door is locked but they've unlocked it, but it's still closed. Or maybe the door is locked and the key is needed to open it. But the user already used the key to unlock it. Hmm.

Looking back at the steps: The original goal was to insert the key into the door to unlock it, then ensure the door is open, then go east. The user did unlock the door, but the game is saying they need to open it first. Maybe the door is unlocked but not open yet. So the next step is to open the door after unlocking it. But how? Maybe the command is "open wooden door" after unlocking. But the user tried "go east" and the game said they need to open the door first. So perhaps after unlocking, they need to open it, then go east.

But the user tried "go east" again, and the game is still saying they need to open the door. Maybe the door is locked, and even though they used the key, it's not considered open. So the correct sequence is: unlock the door, then open it, then go east. But the user might be confused between unlocking and opening. So the next action should be "open wooden door" after unlocking. But the user has already unlocked it, so maybe the game is expecting "open" instead of "unlock". Alternatively, maybe the door is locked and needs to be opened with the key, but the user has already used the key to unlock it. This is a bit conflicting.

The user's previous action was "unlock wooden door", and the game said it's already unlocked. But the game is still requiring them to open it. So perhaps the door is unlocked but not open, so the next step is to open it. So the correct command would be "open wooden door". Then, after that, they can go east. So the next action should be "open wooden door".

You've entered a kitchen.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a refrigerator. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a stove. The stove is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps correctly so far. They opened the trunk, got the key, unlocked the door, opened it, and now entered the kitchen. The next steps were to check the refrigerator, which they did, and found a tomato plant and milk. The original goal was to take the milk from the refrigerator, put it on the stove, etc.

So the next action should be taking the milk. The user needs to take the milk from the refrigerator. The command would be "take milk from refrigerator" or "take milk". Since the refrigerator is open, "take milk" should work. Let me check the previous steps. The user just opened the refrigerator and saw the milk. So the next step is to take the milk. Then place it on the stove. So the correct command here is "take milk".
