It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First step, open the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer in the bedroom. If you can get your hands on the old key, insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After that, travel east. Then, open the screen door. Then, go to the east. Then, attempt to travel south. If you can manage that, lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden. And then, head north. Then, try to travel west. Following that, rest the lettuce on the stove. That's it!

Okay, so you're in a bedroom, cool, but is it standard? You better believe it is.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to reach the goal. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and tried to go east. But the game told them they need to open the wooden door first before going east.

Wait, the user just tried to go east after unlocking the door. But the response said they have to open the wooden door first. Hmm, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the key, inserted it into the door's lock, and then unlocked the door. Then they tried to go east. But the game's response said they need to open the wooden door first. Oh, maybe "unlock" and "open" are different actions here. Maybe after unlocking, they need to open the door to actually pass through it. So the next step should be to open the door after unlocking it. But the user already unlocked it, so maybe the door is now open, and they can proceed east.

Wait, the game's message said "You unlock wooden door." Then the user tried to go east, but the game responded that they need to open the door first. That's confusing. Maybe the game expects them to open the door instead of unlocking it. Or perhaps there's a step missing. Let me think about the original instructions.

The original instructions said: insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. Then ensure the wooden door is open. So after unlocking, they need to open it. Maybe "unlock" is different from "open". So the user has to first unlock the door, then open it. But in the game, after unlocking, the door is already open? Or maybe the user needs to explicitly open it after unlocking.

In the current state, the user has unlocked the door, but the game says they need to open it first. So the next action should be to open the wooden door. Then, after that, they can go east. So the correct next step is to open the door again. But wait, the user already unlocked it. Maybe the game requires them to open it, which might be a separate action. So the user should first open the door, then go east.

But the user tried to go east after unlocking, and the game said they need to open the door first. So the next action should be to open the wooden door. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user's last action was "go east", which the game responded with "You have to open the wooden door first." So the next step is to open the door. Therefore, the correct command is "open wooden door".

Look at that placard! What does it say? It says Welcome to the kitchen? Well that's cool. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can see a closed refrigerator close by. You can make out a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well Were you looking for a kitchen island? Because look over there, it's a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to reach the goal. So far, they've opened the chest drawer in the bedroom, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, went east, and now they're in the kitchen. The current score is 5/7.

The original goal mentioned in the prompt was to explore the world, open the chest drawer, take the key, unlock the door, go east, open the screen door, go east again, travel south, pick up the lettuce, head north, go west, and rest the lettuce on the stove. 

Looking at the current state, the user is in the kitchen. The next steps according to the original plan were after unlocking the door and going east (which they did) to open the screen door. The user's last action was "go east" which led them to the kitchen. Now, the next step in the original plan was to open the screen door. The kitchen description mentions a closed screen door leading east. So the next logical step would be to open that screen door. 

The user's current score is 5/7, so they have a few steps left. The next action should be to open the screen door. The user needs to follow the steps in order, so after going east into the kitchen, they need to open the screen door. The response should be "open screen door".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to reach the goal. So far, they've navigated from the bedroom through the kitchen and into the backyard. The original goal mentioned was to lift the lettuce from the garden and then rest it on the stove, but the current location is the backyard.

Looking at the current scene in the backyard, there's a patio table, chairs, a BBQ, but nothing on them. The user's next step might be to check if there's a garden area where the lettuce is located. The previous steps involved moving east, opening doors, and now they're in the backyard. The instruction said after going east from the kitchen, they should attempt to travel south. But in the backyard, the south entrance is unblocked. Wait, the user is in the backyard, and the next step might be to go south to reach the garden where the lettuce is. However, the current description doesn't mention a garden yet. Maybe the garden is south of the backyard. The user needs to move south to reach the garden, then lift the lettuce. But the user hasn't done that yet. The previous steps were going east, opening the screen door, then going east again to the backyard. Now, the next logical step would be to go south from the backyard to reach the garden area where the lettuce is. So the correct action here is to go south.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps given in the initial instructions. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the door, and went east to the kitchen. Then they opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, and then south to the garden. In the garden, they tried to take the lettuce but couldn't. Then they went back north to the backyard again.

The original goal was to lift the lettuce from the garden and then put it on the stove. The user is now in the backyard again. The previous attempt in the garden failed because they couldn't see the lettuce. Maybe they need to check the garden again. Wait, when they went south to the garden, the description said there was a milk, lettuce, chips, and a shovel on the floor. But when they tried to take the lettuce, the game said they couldn't see it. That's confusing. Maybe the lettuce is not visible unless they look closer or check a specific location.

Alternatively, maybe they need to go back to the garden again. Since they're in the backyard now, going north would take them back to the garden. But the user just went north from the garden to the backyard. Wait, the last action was going north from the garden, which brought them back to the backyard. Now they're in the backyard again. The next step would be to go south again to return to the garden. Then, perhaps check the floor again for the lettuce. But the user might have missed it before. Alternatively, maybe they need to interact with the shovel or another object to uncover the lettuce.

But according to the instructions, after getting the key, they needed to go east, open the screen door, go east, travel south to the garden, lift the lettuce, then head north, travel west, and rest the lettuce on the stove. So the lettuce is in the garden, but the user might have failed to take it because they didn't look properly. So the next step would be to go back to the garden, check again, and take the lettuce. Then proceed to the next steps. But the user is currently in the backyard. So the next action should be to go south to the garden again.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps given in the initial instructions. The goal is to take the lettuce from the garden and then put it on the stove. But in the current scenario, when the user tries to take the lettuce from the floor in the Garden room, the game responds that they can't see any such thing. 

Wait, the description of the Garden room says there's a milk, a lettuce, a half of a bag of chips, and a shovel on the floor. So the lettuce should be there. Maybe the issue is that the user is trying to take the lettuce but the game isn't recognizing it. Maybe the correct command is "take lettuce" without specifying "from floor" since the lettuce is already on the floor. Or perhaps the game expects a different phrasing.

But the user has been using "take lettuce from floor" which isn't working. The game's response is "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the lettuce isn't visible, or the command is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first look around to see the lettuce. But in the game's description, the lettuce is on the floor, so the user should be able to take it. 

Wait, the user's previous action was "take lettuce from floor" which failed. The game might be expecting just "take lettuce" since the lettuce is on the floor. Or maybe the correct command is "pick up lettuce" or "take lettuce from the floor". But the game's response indicates that the lettuce isn't visible. Maybe the user needs to look for it again. However, the game's description says the lettuce is on the floor, so perhaps the user needs to try taking it again without specifying "from floor", or maybe the game has a different command structure.

Alternatively, maybe the user is in the Garden room, and the lettuce is there, but the game's parser isn't recognizing it. The user might need to try a different command, like "get lettuce" or "take lettuce". Since the user has been using "take lettuce from floor", which is incorrect, perhaps the correct command is just "take lettuce".

But the user's last action was "take lettuce from floor" which failed. The next step would be to try "take lettuce" without specifying the floor. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first look around to see the lettuce. However, the game's description already states that the lettuce is on the floor, so the user should be able to take it. 

In the game's current state, the user is in the Garden room, and the lettuce is on the floor. The correct command should be "take lettuce" or "get lettuce". The user might need to try that. Since the previous attempt with "take lettuce from floor" didn't work, perhaps the correct command is just "take lettuce".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps in the TextWorld game. They've already opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the door, and moved through the rooms. Now they're in the Garden, where they need to rest the lettuce on the stove.

Wait, the user tried "rest lettuce on stove" but got an error. The game probably doesn't recognize that command. Maybe the correct verb is "put" instead of "rest"? Or maybe "rest" isn't the right action here. Let me check the previous steps.

The original instructions said: "rest the lettuce on the stove." But the game might expect a different command. Since "rest" isn't working, perhaps the user should use "put" instead. So the correct command would be "put lettuce on stove". That makes sense because "put" is a common verb for placing items.

So the next action should be "put lettuce on stove" to complete the task. Let me make sure there's no other possible command. The user is in the Garden, and the stove is in the Kitchen, but they're currently in the Garden. Wait, no—the user just moved from the Backyard to the Garden, and the Garden has a stove? Or maybe the stove is in the Kitchen. Wait, earlier in the Kitchen, there was a stove. But the user is now in the Garden. Maybe there's a mistake here. But according to the current room description, the Garden has a milk, half bag of chips, and a shovel on the floor. The stove might not be here. Wait, the user was told to rest the lettuce on the stove, but if the stove isn't in the Garden, maybe they need to go back to the Kitchen.

Wait, the user is in the Garden, and the previous step was going north from the Garden to the Backyard. But the Garden's description says there's a milk, chips, and shovel. The stove isn't mentioned here. So maybe there's a confusion. But the original instructions said to rest the lettuce on the stove. So perhaps the stove is in the Kitchen. So the user needs to go back to the Kitchen to put the lettuce on the stove.

But the user is currently in the Garden. So the correct action would be to go north back to the Backyard, then go west to the Kitchen, then put the lettuce on the stove. But the user's last action was going south to the Garden again. So maybe they need to go back to the Kitchen. But the current room is the Garden, and the stove isn't here. Therefore, the user might have a mistake in the steps. However, the game might have the stove in the Garden. Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to use "rest" even though it's not recognized. But the game says "That's not a verb I recognise." So the correct command is "put".

So the next action should be "put lettuce on stove" even though the user is in the Garden. Maybe the game's description is incorrect, but the user has to follow the instructions. Therefore, the correct command is "put lettuce on stove".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete the game by following the steps given. They've already collected the old key, unlocked the door, moved through the kitchen and backyard, and finally reached the garden where they need to rest the lettuce on the stove.

But in the garden, there's no stove mentioned. The items on the floor are milk, half a bag of chips, and a shovel. The user tried "rest lettuce on stove" and "put lettuce on stove", but the game says those aren't valid commands. The problem is that the stove isn't in the garden description. Maybe the stove is in the kitchen? Wait, in the kitchen, the description says there's a stove, but it's not mentioned to be in the garden. The user is in the garden, so they can't access the stove there.

So the correct action would be to go back to the kitchen where the stove is. But how? The user is in the garden, and the exit is north to the backyard. Wait, the garden's description says to try going north. So maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen via the backyard. Let me check the previous steps.

The user was in the garden, then went north to the backyard, then south back to the garden. The kitchen was accessed earlier when they went east from the bedroom. So maybe the user needs to go back through the backyard to the kitchen. But the current location is the garden. The only way out is north to the backyard. So the user needs to go north to the backyard, then find the exit to the kitchen. Wait, in the backyard, there's an open screen door west, but the user is in the garden. Maybe the user needs to go back through the screen door to the kitchen. But the user is in the garden, so going north to the backyard, then west through the screen door to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, there's a stove. So the correct sequence is: from garden, go north to backyard, then west through the screen door to the kitchen, then go north to the stove.

But the user is currently in the garden, and the last action was "go south" to the garden again. The next step should be to go north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen, then north to the stove. However, the user's current location is the garden, so the next command should be "go north" to the backyard. Then, in the backyard, go west through the screen door to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, go north to the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action is to go north from the garden to the backyard.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Garden and Backyard. They've been trying to get the lettuce on the stove but can't because the stove isn't in the Garden. The key steps from the original instructions were: after getting the lettuce, go north to the kitchen, then rest the lettuce on the stove.

But in the current state, the user is in the Garden, which is connected to the Backyard. The Garden has the lettuce on the floor, but the stove is in the kitchen. The user has the lettuce, so they need to go back to the kitchen. However, the current commands are repeatedly going south and north between the Garden and Backyard, which doesn't help.

The mistake here is that the user hasn't gone back to the kitchen yet. The Garden's north exit leads to the Backyard, not the kitchen. The kitchen was previously visited, so maybe the user is getting confused with the locations. The correct path is: Garden (with lettuce) → go north to the Backyard, then find the kitchen entrance. Wait, but the Backyard's north exit is blocked. The user needs to go west from the Backyard to the Kitchen, then proceed to the stove.

Wait, the user is in the Garden, which is connected to the Backyard. From the Backyard, the screen door leads west to the Kitchen. So the correct sequence is: Garden → go north to Backyard → go west to Kitchen → then rest the lettuce on the stove. But the user hasn't tried that yet. They keep going south and north, missing the west direction in the Backyard.

So the next action should be, when in the Backyard, to go west to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, rest the lettuce on the stove. But the user hasn't tried that. The previous attempts were going south, which loops back to the Garden. Therefore, the correct next step is to go west from the Backyard to the Kitchen.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to achieve the goal. The current situation is that they're in the Bathroom, and the previous actions have led them to this point. The goal mentioned earlier was to rest the lettuce on the stove, but the user has been moving around different rooms without successfully doing that.

Looking at the latest prompt, the user is in the Bathroom and needs to go south to return to the Kitchen. The score is still at 9, which suggests that they haven't completed all the required steps yet. The original plan was to take the lettuce from the Garden, then go north to the Backyard, then rest the lettuce on the stove. However, the user has been moving between rooms without completing these steps, possibly due to confusion or getting stuck in a loop.

The key issue here is that the user hasn't successfully placed the lettuce on the stove. The previous attempts to do so in the Garden were met with "You can't see any such thing," which might mean that the lettuce isn't in the right place or the stove isn't accessible. The user might need to go back to the Garden, ensure the lettuce is there, and then find the stove in the Kitchen. But the current path seems to be leading them back to the Kitchen, which might not have the stove in the right location.

Alternatively, maybe the stove is in the Kitchen, and the user needs to go north from the Kitchen to reach the Bathroom, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, the Kitchen has an unguarded exit to the south, and the Bathroom is connected to the Kitchen. The user might need to go back to the Kitchen, check the stove there, and then place the lettuce on it. However, the lettuce was picked up in the Garden, so the user needs to carry it from the Garden to the Kitchen.

But in the current state, the user is in the Bathroom, so the next logical step would be to go south back to the Kitchen. Once in the Kitchen, they can check the stove and place the lettuce there. The score is still at 9, so they need to complete the remaining steps to reach the goal. The user might have been moving around without focusing on the key task of placing the lettuce on the stove. The correct sequence would be: Garden (take lettuce) → Backyard (go north) → Kitchen (rest lettuce on stove). But the user's path has taken them through the Bathroom, which might be a detour.

So the next action should be to go south from the Bathroom back to the Kitchen, then proceed to the stove and place the lettuce. The user needs to ensure they're in the right room with the lettuce and the stove available. The key is to not get stuck in loops and to follow the correct path to complete the task.

Look at that placard! What does it say? It says Welcome to the kitchen? Well that's cool. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can see a closed refrigerator close by. You can make out a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well Were you looking for a kitchen island? Because look over there, it's a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

You are in a bathroom. An ordinary kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You see a closed toilet. You make out a bath. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You scan the room, seeing a sink. You shudder, but continue examining the sink. You see a toothbrush on the sink. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to achieve the goal. From the history, they've been moving through different rooms: bedroom, kitchen, backyard, garden, bathroom, and back to the kitchen. The main goal seems to involve collecting items and moving through the house.

The user currently is in the kitchen again, with the score at 9/41. The previous attempts to rest the lettuce on the stove failed because the stove wasn't visible. The user tried going back and forth between rooms, but couldn't find the stove. Now, they need to figure out how to proceed.

In the kitchen description, there's a mention of a stove, but it's not clear if it's visible or if there's a need to open it. The user has the lettuce, so the next step might be to use the stove. However, the game might require specific commands like "open stove" or "use stove" before resting the lettuce. Since the user tried "rest lettuce on stove" and it didn't work, maybe they need to first interact with the stove.

Alternatively, maybe the stove is in a different part of the kitchen. The user might need to check the kitchen island or the counter. The note on the kitchen island could be a clue. But the user hasn't checked that yet. However, the previous attempts to go north led back to the bathroom, so maybe the stove is in a different location.

Wait, in the garden, the user had the lettuce, but couldn't rest it on the stove because the stove wasn't there. Now, in the kitchen, the stove is mentioned. Maybe the user needs to go to the stove's location. But the description says the stove is "unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it," which might mean it's not visible or needs to be opened.

The correct command might be to "open stove" first, then "rest lettuce on stove." But the user hasn't tried that yet. Alternatively, maybe the stove is already open, and the user just needs to place the lettuce there. However, the game's response said "You can't see any such thing" when trying to rest the lettuce, so maybe the stove isn't in the current room's description.

Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is mentioned as "unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it." Maybe the stove is closed, so the user needs to open it first. So the next step would be to open the stove, then rest the lettuce on it. But the user hasn't tried opening the stove yet. So the correct action here is to "open stove" to make it possible to rest the lettuce.

It isn't something you can open.
