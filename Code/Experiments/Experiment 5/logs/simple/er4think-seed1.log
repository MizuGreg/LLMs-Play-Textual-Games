Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, look and see that the antique trunk inside the bedroom is opened. Then, recover the old key from the antique trunk. Then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked. After unlocking the wooden door, open the wooden door in the bedroom. Then, try to head east. After that, try to travel south. Once you get through with that, take the milk from the couch within the living room. Having taken the milk, attempt to travel north. That done, rest the milk on the stove inside the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You make a grand eccentric entrance into a bedroom.

You see a closed normal looking chest drawer right there by you. You can see an antique trunk. You see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've already done a few steps. They started in the bedroom, looked at the antique trunk, opened it, and found an old key. Now they need to proceed with the next steps as per the original instructions.

The next step after getting the key was to make sure the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. The user mentioned that after unlocking the door, they need to open it and then go east, south, etc. So the current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door leading east is closed. The key they found might be needed to unlock it, but maybe not. Wait, the original instructions said to unlock the wooden door, but the key might be for something else. But in the game, sometimes keys are used to unlock doors. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user has the key now. The next step was to unlock the wooden door. So maybe they need to use the key on the door. But the door is closed. So the action would be to unlock it. But how? In text adventures, you usually use the key to unlock a door. So the next step would be to unlock the door with the key. Then open the door. Then go east, then south, etc.

But the user's last action was opening the trunk and getting the key. Now they need to proceed to unlock the door. So the next command should be to unlock the wooden door. But the game might require using the key on the door. So the correct action here is to unlock the door with the key. So the next command is "unlock wooden door" or "use key on wooden door". But in the game's context, maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door". Let me check the previous responses. The user was told to "make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked. After unlocking the wooden door, open the wooden door in the bedroom." So the steps are: unlock the door, then open it. So the next action is to unlock the door. Therefore, the correct command is "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps given. They've opened the antique trunk and found the key. Then they tried to unlock the wooden door, but the game says the door is fixed in place. Hmm, maybe the key is needed to unlock it. Wait, the user has the key, so maybe they need to use it on the door. The previous action was "unlock wooden door", but the door didn't open. Maybe the correct command is "use key on wooden door" instead. Let me check the game's possible commands. Since the key is in hand, using it on the door should work. So the next action should be to use the key on the door. But the user might not have the key in their inventory yet. Wait, they just retrieved the key from the trunk, so they should have it. So the next step is to use the key to unlock the door. Then, after unlocking, they can open the door. So the command should be "use key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door" again. But the game might require the exact phrase. Let me think. The user's last action was "unlock wooden door", which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "use key on wooden door". Alternatively, maybe the door can be opened directly once unlocked. But the game's response said the door is fixed. So perhaps the key is needed to unlock it. Therefore, the next action is to use the key on the door.

Okay, the user tried to use the key on the wooden door, but the game didn't recognize that command. Maybe the correct way is to "unlock the door" instead. Wait, the user already tried "unlock wooden door" earlier, but it didn't work. Maybe the door needs to be unlocked first, and then opened. Alternatively, maybe the key is for a different lock. Let me check the previous steps again. The user has the key from the trunk. The door is closed. The game says the door is fixed in place. So perhaps the correct action is to "unlock the wooden door" again, but the game might require a different phrasing. Or maybe the user needs to "open the wooden door" after unlocking. But the game didn't recognize "use key on wooden door". Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" without specifying wooden. Alternatively, maybe the key is for the trunk, not the door. Wait, the original goal was to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. So the user needs to unlock it. Maybe the correct command is "unlock door" or "unlock the door". Let me try that.

It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove. You see a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, the user is in the living room and needs to go north. The previous attempt to say "go north" was misunderstood. The correct command is definitely "go north". The user might have been confused by the previous error, but the game expects the action to be repeated. So the next action is "go north".

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, the user is stuck again. They've tried "go north" multiple times, but the game is responding with "I beg your pardon?" Maybe there's a typo or the command isn't recognized. Let me check the previous steps. The user is in the living room, took the milk, and needs to go north. The correct command should be "go north" without any extra words. Maybe the game is expecting "go" instead of "go north"? Or perhaps "north" as a standalone command. Let me try "go north" again, but the game is still not recognizing it. Wait, maybe the user needs to use "move north" instead. But the original instructions said "try to head east" and "try to travel south", so "go north" is the right command. The game might have a typo in its response, but the correct action is still "go north". I'll try that one more time.

-= Kitchen =-
Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. The room is well lit.

You make out a closed refrigerator nearby. You can see a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove. You see a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, the user is in the kitchen again after trying to go north. The game says "That's not a verb I recognise." So the command "go south" is invalid here. The kitchen has an exit to the north and a screen door east, but the user needs to find the correct direction. The original goal was to go east, then south. But in the kitchen, the correct action might be to go east through the screen door. Let me check the room description again. The kitchen has a closed screen door leading east. So the correct command is "go east" or "open screen door". But the user was told to go south from the living room, but that led back to the kitchen. Maybe the user needs to go east from the kitchen. So the next action is "go east".

Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. The room is well lit.

You make out a closed refrigerator nearby. You can see a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove. You see a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. The room is well lit.

You make out a closed refrigerator nearby. You can see a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove. You see a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Well I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the living room.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a couch. However, the couch, like an empty couch, has nothing on it. You see a low table. The low table is standard. On the low table you see a remote. You scan the room for a tv, and you find a tv. The tv is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
