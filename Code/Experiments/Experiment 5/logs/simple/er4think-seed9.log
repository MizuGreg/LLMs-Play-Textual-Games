Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be good if you could open the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. With the old key, unlock the wooden door. Then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. After that, make an effort to head east. If you can accomplish that, open the refrigerator inside the kitchen. After that, recover the lettuce from the refrigerator in the kitchen. After that, rest the lettuce on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. Let's see what's in here.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You see an antique trunk. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps to open the chest drawer, take the old key, unlock the wooden door, and now the door is unlocked. The next step according to the original task was to ensure the wooden door is open. Since they just unlocked it, maybe they need to check if it's open. But the game might automatically consider it open after unlocking. Then, the next action was to head east. So after unlocking, the next step is to go east. The user's next action should be "go east" to proceed to the kitchen. Let me confirm the previous steps: the user has unlocked the door, so now they need to move east. The next step in the task is to open the refrigerator in the kitchen. So the correct command here is "go east".

Okay, the user tried to go east after unlocking the door, but the game said they have to open the wooden door first. Wait, but they just unlocked it. Maybe "unlock" and "open" are different actions here. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user unlocked the wooden door with the old key. The game's response was "You unlock wooden door." Then the next prompt says "You have to open the wooden door first." Hmm, that's conflicting. Maybe the game expects them to open it again after unlocking? Or maybe there's a misunderstanding between unlocking and opening. Let me think about the task description. The original task said: "ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open." So after unlocking, they need to open it. But when you unlock a door, is it automatically open? Or does the game require a separate "open" action?

In the previous steps, after opening the chest drawer and taking the key, the user unlocked the door. Now, the game is prompting them to open the door first. So maybe the correct next step is to open the door again. But why would they need to open it after unlocking? Maybe the door is locked again, or the game's logic requires both actions. Alternatively, maybe the user didn't actually open the door yet, just unlocked it. So the next step would be to open the door. Then, after that, they can go east. So the next command should be "open wooden door".

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

A closed refrigerator is here. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. The counter is ordinary. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly infuriated by your TextWorld experience. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island, so there's that.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the kitchen now. The task was to open the refrigerator, take the lettuce, put it on the stove, and then win. So the next step is to open the refrigerator. The user has already gone east from the bedroom, so now they need to open the closed refrigerator. The game's current state shows the refrigerator is closed, so the correct action here is to open it. Let me check the previous steps again. The user has opened the door, gone east to the kitchen, and the refrigerator is closed. So the next command should be "open refrigerator".

Okay, the user opened the refrigerator and found a lettuce. The next step according to the task is to take the lettuce. So the correct action here is "take lettuce from refrigerator". Let me make sure that's the right command. The game says the refrigerator has a lettuce, so taking it would be the next logical step. Then, after taking the lettuce, they need to rest it on the stove. But first, they have to take it. So the next command should be "take lettuce from refrigerator".

Okay, the user tried to "rest lettuce on stove" but the game said that's not a recognized verb. So I need to think of the correct command. The task says to "rest the lettuce on the stove". Maybe the correct action is "put lettuce on stove". Let me check the possible commands. The user has the lettuce in hand, so the next step is to place it on the stove. The correct command should be "put lettuce on stove". "Rest" might not be a valid verb here, so "put" is better. Let me confirm that "put" is an allowed action. Since the game uses "put" in similar contexts, that's probably the right command.

Okay, the user is trying to place the lettuce on the stove but keeps getting errors. The previous attempt was "rest lettuce on stove", which didn't work. Then they tried "put lettuce on stove", but the game says that's not a recognized verb. Hmm, maybe the correct command is different. Let me think about possible verbs in the game. The user has the lettuce, so maybe they need to use "place" instead of "put". Alternatively, maybe the stove is called something else, like "stove" or "heat source". Wait, the game's current location is the kitchen, and the stove is mentioned as a object. So the correct command might be "place lettuce on stove". But the game says "rest" and "put" aren't valid. Maybe the correct verb is "put" but the game expects a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "put lettuce on the stove" with the article "the". Let me check the previous interactions. The user said "rest lettuce on stove" and "put lettuce on stove". The game didn't accept those. Maybe the correct command is "put lettuce on stove" but with the word "the" included. Wait, the game might require "put lettuce on the stove". Let me try that. Alternatively, maybe the stove is already open, so the user just needs to put it there. But the game's error says the verb is unrecognized. Maybe the correct verb is "place". Let me try "place lettuce on stove". If that doesn't work, maybe the game expects "put" but with a different structure. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "put" followed by the object and then the location. But the game's error suggests that "put" is not recognized as a verb here. Maybe the correct action is "put lettuce on stove" but the game is case-sensitive or has a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "put" with the article, like "put the lettuce on the stove". But the user has the lettuce in hand, so maybe just "put lettuce on stove". However, the game says that's not a recognized verb. I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of other possible commands. Maybe "place" is the correct verb. Let me try "place lettuce on stove".

Okay, the user is having trouble getting the lettuce on the stove. They tried "rest", "put", and "place", but none worked. Let me think about possible commands again. Maybe the correct verb is "put" but with the article "the". The game might require "put the lettuce on the stove". But the user hasn't used the article. Alternatively, maybe the stove is called something else, like "stove" or "heat source". Wait, the game's description says there's a stove in the kitchen. So the correct command might be "put lettuce on stove" but the game doesn't recognize "put" as a verb here. Maybe the game uses "place" as the verb, but that didn't work either. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "put" with the object and location, like "put lettuce on stove". The game's error says "That's not a verb I recognise", so maybe "put" is not allowed. Maybe the correct action is "put" followed by the object and then the location, but the game expects a different structure. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "put" with the article, like "put the lettuce on the stove". But the user hasn't used the article. Let me try that. The user has the lettuce, so maybe "put the lettuce on the stove" is the correct command. But the game might not accept the article. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "put lettuce on stove" without the article. But the game says "put" isn't recognized. Maybe the game uses a different verb, like "place" or "rest", but those didn't work. Hmm, maybe the user needs to use "put" but the game expects a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the stove is already open, so the user just needs to put the lettuce there. But the game isn't recognizing the command. Maybe the correct action is "put" followed by the object and location, but the game is case-sensitive. Let me try "put lettuce on stove" again. If that doesn't work, maybe the game expects "put" as a verb, but the user is using the wrong form. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "put" with the article, like "put the lettuce on the stove". But the user hasn't used the article. I'm not sure, but maybe the correct command is "put the lettuce on the stove".
