It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to make absolutely sure that the antique trunk is opened. And then, take the old key from the antique trunk within the bedroom. After that, check that the wooden door within the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. After that, look and see that the wooden door is open. After that, try to move east. After that, open the screen door in the kitchen. And then, venture east. Then, attempt to travel south. And then, lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden. If you have picked up the lettuce, travel north. And then, try to move west. Then, rest the lettuce on the stove. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
I am excited to announce that you are now in the bedroom. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You make out a chest drawer. Hmm. You always thought you'd be more excited to see a chest drawer in a room. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to an antique trunk. You can make out a king-size bed. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has already completed several steps. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and now they're at the door. The next step according to the original task was to check if the wooden door is open. But the user hasn't done that yet.

Wait, the user's last action was unlocking the wooden door. The next step in the task was to "look and see that the wooden door is open." So the user needs to verify that the door is indeed open after unlocking it. But the game's response after unlocking the door didn't mention the door's state. However, in TextWorld, after unlocking, the door should be open. But maybe the user needs to explicitly check it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to open the door. Wait, the original task says "check that the wooden door within the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. After that, look and see that the wooden door is open." So first, unlock it, then check if it's open. But if the door was already open, maybe the user needs to open it again. Or perhaps the unlocking is sufficient. But the user's next action should be to check the door's state.

But the user's current location is in the bedroom, and the wooden door is east. So the next step is to look at the door to confirm it's open. So the command would be "look at wooden door" or "check wooden door". However, in TextWorld, the available commands might be different. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to open the door. Wait, the original task says after unlocking, check that it's open. So maybe the user needs to open the door. But the door was already unlocked. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to open the door. The original task says "look and see that the wooden door is open." So the user needs to check if it's open. But in the game, after unlocking, the door might be open. So the next action is to check the door's state. But the user is in the bedroom, and the door is east. So the user should try to open the door. Wait, but the door was already unlocked. Maybe the user needs to open it. But the game might require the user to open it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check if it's open. But the user's next action should be to open the door. Wait, the original task says after unlocking, check that it's open. So maybe the user needs to open the door. But the door was already unlocked. Maybe the user needs to open it. But the game might have the door as a door that can be opened. So the next action is to open the door. But the user is in the bedroom, and the door is east. So the user should go east to check. Wait, the original task says after unlocking, look and see that the door is open. So the user needs to check the door's state. So the next action is to look at the door. But the available commands might be "open wooden door" or "look at wooden door". But the user's previous action was unlocking the door. So maybe the next step is to open the door. But the door was already unlocked. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go through the door. But the task says to check that it's open. So the user should check the door's state. So the next action is to look at the door. But the user is in the bedroom. So the command would be "look at wooden door" or "check wooden door". But in the game, the user might need to open the door. However, since the user has already unlocked it, maybe the door is open. So the next step is to move east. But the original task says after checking that the door is open, then try to move east. Wait, the original task says: "After that, look and see that the wooden door is open. After that, try to move east." So the user needs to check that the door is open, then move east. So the next action is to check the door's state. But how? The user is in the bedroom. The door is east. So the user can try to open the door. But since it's already unlocked, maybe the user can just move east. But the task says to check that it's open first. So maybe the user needs to open the door. But the door is already unlocked. So the user can just move east. But the task says to check that it's open. So the user should first check the door's state. Therefore, the next action is to open the door. But the user has already unlocked it. So perhaps the user can move east. But the user needs to confirm the door is open. So maybe the user should try to open the door. But the door is already unlocked. So the user can just move east. But the task says to check that it's open. So the user should check. Therefore, the next action is to open the door. But the user is in the bedroom. So the command would be "open wooden door". But if the door is already open, that might not be necessary. Alternatively, the user can check the door's state by looking at it. But the game might not have a "look" command. So the user needs to open the door. But the user has already unlocked it. So the next action is to move east. But the user needs to check that the door is open. So perhaps the user should open the door. But the user is in the bedroom. So the next action is to open the door. But the user has already unlocked it. So maybe the user can move east. But the task says to check that the door is open. So the user needs to check. Therefore, the next action is to open the door. But the user is in the bedroom. So the command is "open wooden door". But if the door is already open, the game might not allow that. So the user should check the door's state. But the user can't check it unless they open it. So the user needs to open the door. Therefore, the next action is to open the wooden door.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has followed a specific set of steps. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. Then they tried to move east, but the system kept prompting them to name something more substantial. Hmm, maybe the command "move east" isn't valid here anymore because they've opened the door, so the next room is accessible.

Wait, after opening the wooden door, the next step was to move east. But the system said "You must name something more substantial." That suggests that "move east" isn't the correct command now. Maybe the door is the screen door in the kitchen? Or perhaps the next room is the kitchen, and the correct action is to open the screen door there. But the user's next step after moving east would be to open the screen door in the kitchen. But the user tried to move east again, which might not be the right action now.

Alternatively, maybe after opening the wooden door, the user is now in the kitchen, and the next step is to open the screen door. But the user's previous action was moving east, which might not be correct. The system is probably expecting a different command now. Let me check the original task again. The user had to open the screen door in the kitchen after moving east. So maybe after moving east, they need to open the screen door. But the system is rejecting "move east" again, so perhaps the correct action is to open the screen door now. But the user is in the kitchen, so maybe they need to open the screen door first. But the user's last action was moving east, which might not be valid. The system is probably expecting "open screen door" instead. But the user's next action should be to open the screen door in the kitchen. However, the user's previous attempt to move east was rejected, so maybe they need to try a different command. Alternatively, maybe the correct action is to open the screen door now. But the user is in the kitchen, so they need to open the screen door. So the next command should be "open screen door".

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. Then they tried to move east, but the system kept prompting them to name something more substantial. Then they tried moving east again, but it didn't work. Now they're at a point where they need to open the screen door in the kitchen, but the system says they can't see any such thing.

Wait, the user's last action was trying to move east after opening the wooden door. But the system said "You must name something more substantial." Maybe they tried to move east without actually being able to. Then they tried moving east again, but it's still not working. Now, the next step according to the original task was to open the screen door in the kitchen after moving east. But since they can't see the screen door, maybe they need to check the kitchen first.

But the user is in the bedroom, and after opening the wooden door (which leads east), they might be in the kitchen. But the system says they can't see the screen door. Maybe the screen door is in the kitchen, and they need to go there first. Alternatively, maybe the screen door is in another location. Wait, the original task said after moving east, open the screen door in the kitchen. So perhaps after moving east, they are in the kitchen, but the screen door isn't visible. Maybe they need to look around or check the kitchen's description.

But the user's last action was trying to move east again, which was invalid. So maybe the correct next step is to check the kitchen's description to find the screen door. However, the user is supposed to input commands like "open screen door" but the system says it's not there. So perhaps the correct action is to look around in the kitchen to find the screen door. But the user's instructions say to only output the action, so maybe "look around" or "examine kitchen". But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the screen door is in the kitchen, and the user needs to open it once they are there.

Wait, the user's previous action was moving east, which might have led them to the kitchen. But the system said they can't see the screen door. So maybe the next step is to open the screen door, but the system is blocking it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the kitchen's description again. But since the user can't type, they have to follow the commands. The original task says after moving east, open the screen door. So maybe the user should try "open screen door" again, but the system says it's not there. Therefore, maybe the correct action is to look for the screen door in the kitchen. But the user can't type that. Alternatively, maybe the user is in the kitchen and needs to open the screen door, but the system is not allowing it. So perhaps the next action is to try opening the screen door again, even though the system says it's not there. But that might not work. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the kitchen's description again to find the screen door. But the user can't type that. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to move east again, but the system is blocking it. The user tried moving east again, but the system said "You must name something more substantial." So maybe the correct action is to move east again, but the system is not allowing it. Therefore, the user needs to find another way. Maybe the next step is to check the kitchen's description again, but the user can't type that. Alternatively, maybe the user is in the kitchen and needs to open the screen door. But the system says it's not there. So perhaps the user is stuck here and needs to find another way. But according to the original task, after moving east, they need to open the screen door.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. Then they tried to move east, but the system said to name something more substantial. Then they tried "move east" again, but it didn't work. Next, they tried to open the screen door, but it wasn't there. The user is now stuck again.

Hmm, the problem might be that after opening the wooden door and moving east, they enter the kitchen. The next step was to open the screen door in the kitchen. But the user tried "open screen door" and got "You can't see any such thing." So maybe the screen door isn't in the kitchen, or it's called something else. Alternatively, maybe after moving east from the bedroom, they are in the kitchen, but the screen door is not there. Wait, the original instructions said to open the screen door in the kitchen after moving east. But perhaps the correct command is different. Maybe it's "open door" or "open kitchen door" instead of "screen door." Or maybe the screen door is part of the kitchen's description but needs a different command.

Alternatively, maybe after moving east, the user is in the kitchen, and the screen door is there. But the user tried "open screen door" and it didn't work. So perhaps the correct command is "open door" or "open the screen door." But the system says "can't see any such thing," so maybe the screen door isn't there. Wait, maybe the user needs to look around first to find the screen door. But the user hasn't looked yet. However, in the game, sometimes you have to use the correct noun. Maybe the screen door is actually a "door" or "window" or something else. Alternatively, maybe the user is in the kitchen, and the screen door is the only door there, but the correct command is "open door."

Alternatively, maybe the user is in the kitchen, and the screen door is a specific object. But the user tried "open screen door" and it didn't work. So maybe the correct command is "open door" or "open the door." But the user's previous attempt was "open screen door," which didn't work. So the next step would be to try "open door" or check if there's another way to open it.

But the user is supposed to follow the steps: after moving east, open the screen door in the kitchen. So maybe the screen door is there, but the user needs to use the correct command. Alternatively, maybe the screen door is not present, and the user needs to find another way. But according to the original task, the user is supposed to open the screen door in the kitchen. So perhaps the correct command is "open screen door," but the game is not recognizing it. Maybe the user needs to use a different verb, like "use key" or something else. But the user has the old key, which was used to unlock the wooden door. Maybe the screen door requires a key as well. But the user hasn't picked up the key yet. Wait, no, the user already took the old key from the trunk. So maybe the screen door can be opened with the key. But the user hasn't tried that yet.

Alternatively, maybe the screen door is a different type of door. Maybe the user needs to "open the door" instead of "screen door." But the user tried "open screen door" and it didn't work. So perhaps the correct command is "open door." Let me think. The user is in the kitchen after moving east. The original instruction says to open the screen door in the kitchen. So maybe the screen door is there, but the user needs to use the correct command. Maybe the game expects "open door" instead of "screen door." So the next action should be "open door." But the user tried "open screen door" and it didn't work. So maybe the correct command is "open door." Alternatively, maybe the screen door is not present, and the user needs to look for another way. But according to the original task, the user is supposed to open the screen door. So perhaps the user needs to try "open door" next.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. Then they tried to move east, but the system kept prompting them to name something more substantial. They tried "move east" again, but it didn't work. Then they tried opening the screen door, which didn't exist, and tried opening the door again, which was already open.

Now, the user is at the bedroom again, and the next step in their original plan was to venture east after opening the screen door in the kitchen. But since the screen door isn't there, maybe they need to find another way to proceed. The current room is the bedroom, and the only exit mentioned is the eastern wooden door, which they've already opened. So perhaps after moving east, they would enter the kitchen, but the screen door might be in the kitchen. However, the user tried to open the screen door from the bedroom and it didn't work. Maybe they need to check the kitchen's description for the screen door.

Alternatively, maybe after moving east from the bedroom, they can find the screen door in the kitchen. But since the user is stuck in the bedroom, they need to move east first. The previous attempt to move east was rejected, but maybe the correct command is "go east" instead of "move east". The game might be sensitive to the exact command. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "move east" and got "You must name something more substantial." Then tried "open screen door" which didn't work. So maybe the correct command is "go east" instead of "move east". Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen now. The original goal was to go through various steps, including opening the screen door in the kitchen and then moving east. But the user tried "open screen door" before and it didn't work. Now, in the kitchen, there's a closed screen door east and an open wooden door west. The user's last action was "go east", which led them to the kitchen. Now, they need to open the screen door in the kitchen. But the previous attempt to open it failed. Wait, maybe the screen door is closed, so they need to open it. The note on the kitchen island might be a clue, but the user hasn't checked it yet. However, the current task is to open the screen door east. So the next action should be to open the screen door. But the user tried that and got "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the screen door isn't there? Wait, the kitchen description says there's a closed screen door leading east. So the user should try opening it again. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the note first. But according to the original plan, after entering the kitchen, the next step was to open the screen door. So the correct action is to open the screen door again. The user might have missed it before. So the next command should be "open screen door".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door in the bedroom, then moved east to the kitchen. They opened the screen door in the kitchen. Now, the next step according to the original task was to "venture east" after opening the screen door. But the user might be confused because the kitchen's screen door is east, and maybe they need to check if there's a way to proceed further.

Looking at the current location in the kitchen, the description mentions a screen door leading east, an open wooden door west, and suggests trying north or south. The user's last action was opening the screen door, which might have allowed them to move east. However, the game's response after opening the screen door didn't indicate a new location, so maybe the user needs to move east from the kitchen. The next step in the original plan was to "attempt to travel south" after venturing east. But in the kitchen, the possible directions are north, south, west, or east. Since the screen door is east, maybe moving east from the kitchen is the next step. However, the user might have already moved east, so perhaps they need to check the next steps. Alternatively, the user might need to go south from the kitchen. But according to the original task, after opening the screen door in the kitchen, they should "venture east" and then "attempt to travel south." So after opening the screen door, the next action would be to move east. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the user's last action was opening the screen door, and the current location is the kitchen. The next step would be to move east from the kitchen. But the game's description says that after opening the screen door, the user is in the kitchen. So the next action should be to go east. However, the user might have already done that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the next steps. But the user's next action should be to move east from the kitchen. So the correct command here is "go east."

-= Backyard =-
You arrive in a backyard. A standard kind of place.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a set of chairs. The set of chairs is usual. The set of chairs appears to be empty. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a bbq. Now why would someone leave that there? The bbq is typical. But there isn't a thing on it. You scan the room for a patio table, and you find a patio table. You shudder, but continue examining the patio table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user needs to pick up the lettuce from the garden and then rest it on the stove. So far, they've reached the garden. The current step is to lift the lettuce. The next action should be to pick it up. Then, after picking it up, they need to travel north and then west, then rest the lettuce on the stove. But the immediate next step is to take the lettuce. The command should be "take lettuce from floor" or something similar. Wait, the game's previous steps had "take old key from antique trunk", so maybe the correct syntax here is "take lettuce from floor of garden" but the exact phrasing might matter. The user is in the garden, and the lettuce is on the floor. So the correct command is "take lettuce from floor".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps in the TextWorld game. They've already opened the antique trunk, taken the key, unlocked and opened the bedroom door, moved east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, and then south to the garden. Now, in the garden, they need to pick up the lettuce from the floor.

The user tried "take lettuce from floor" but got a "You can't see any such thing" response. Wait, but according to the garden description, there's a lettuce on the floor. Maybe the command should just be "take lettuce" without specifying "from floor" since the game might automatically pick it up if it's on the floor. Let me check the previous steps again. The garden says: "There is a milk, an apple, a lettuce and a shovel on the floor." So the lettuce is indeed there. The correct command should be "take lettuce" without the "from floor" part. The error might be because the game expects the player to just pick it up by name, not specifying the location. So the next action should be "take lettuce".

Okay, let's see. The user has to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, moved east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, then south to the garden. In the garden, they picked up the lettuce and went north back to the backyard.

Now, the next step according to the original task was to "rest the lettuce on the stove." But the user is currently in the backyard. The stove is in the kitchen. So they need to go back to the kitchen, then find the stove and place the lettuce there.

But the current location is the backyard. The previous action was going north from the garden to the backyard. The user needs to go west back to the kitchen. Wait, in the backyard description, there's an open screen door leading west. So they should go west to return to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, they can go north to the dining room or something else, but the stove is there. Wait, in the kitchen, the stove is mentioned as being there. So once in the kitchen, they can rest the lettuce on the stove.

But the user's last action was going north from the garden to the backyard. Now, they need to go west from the backyard to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, they can rest the lettuce on the stove. Then, the game would be won.

So the next command should be "go west" from the backyard to get back to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, "rest lettuce on stove". But the user is currently in the backyard, so the next step is to go west.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to complete the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the trunk, took the key, unlocked and opened the door, then moved east to the kitchen. Then they tried opening the screen door, which wasn't there, but eventually found the kitchen again. Then they went to the backyard, picked up the lettuce, went north back to the backyard, then west to the kitchen again. Now they're in the kitchen again, and the next step is to rest the lettuce on the stove.

Wait, the original goal was to lift the lettuce from the garden, then travel north, then west, then rest it on the stove. The user picked up the lettuce in the garden, went north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. Now they're in the kitchen. The next action should be to put the lettuce on the stove. But the stove is in the kitchen. So the command would be "put lettuce on stove" or something similar. But the game's previous commands were more about moving and interacting with objects. Let me check the previous steps.

In the garden, after picking up the lettuce, they went north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. Now in the kitchen, the stove is present. So the next step is to rest the lettuce on the stove. The correct command here would be "put lettuce on stove" or "rest lettuce on stove". But the game's previous interactions used "rest" in the instruction, like "rest the lettuce on the stove". So the user needs to do that now. The current location is the kitchen, so the command should be "rest lettuce on stove".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to rest the lettuce on the stove. The previous attempt didn't work because "rest" isn't a recognized verb here. Maybe the correct command is "put" instead of "rest". In many text adventures, "put X on Y" is the standard way to place an item. So, the user should try "put lettuce on stove". Let me check the game's context again. The goal was to rest the lettuce on the stove after picking it up. Since "rest" isn't working, switching to "put" makes sense. I'll suggest that as the next action.
