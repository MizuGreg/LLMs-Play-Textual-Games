I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar. After opening the wooden door, go east. Then, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. And then, attempt to travel east. And then, try to travel south. With that done, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After stealing the milk, head north. And then, attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You think about smashing the king-size bed to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and tried to make it ajar. But the system didn't recognize "ajar" as a verb, so they tried "unlock" again, which worked but maybe wasn't the right action.

The user is now asking if they're on the right track and what their next move should be. The goal is to eventually get the milk from the garden, so they need to proceed through the door. The current step is to make sure the wooden door is ajar. Since "ajar" isn't a valid command, maybe the correct action is to open the door instead. But the door is already unlocked. Alternatively, maybe "push" or "open" is the correct verb here. The user tried "unlock" again, which might not be the right action. The system's response after "ajar" was that it's not a recognized verb, so they need to use the correct command. The next step after unlocking is to open the door, so the correct command would be "open wooden door". Then, after that, go east as instructed. So the next action should be to open the door.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this TextWorld game. They've been moving through rooms, opening doors, and collecting items. The current problem is that they're trying to take the milk from the floor in the garden, but the game says they can't see any such thing.

First, I need to check if the milk is actually present. The previous message from the game says: "There is a milk, a half of a bag of chips, a lettuce and a shovel on the floor." So the milk is there. But when the user tried to take it, the game responded with "You can't see any such thing." That's confusing because the game just mentioned the milk is on the floor.

Maybe the issue is that the milk is not visible because it's covered by something else. The user might need to look around more carefully. Alternatively, maybe the command syntax is wrong. The correct command should be "take milk" instead of "take milk from floor," but the user tried "take milk from floor" and it didn't work. Wait, the game's message says the milk is on the floor, so perhaps the correct command is just "take milk" without specifying the floor. Let me check the previous steps.

In the Garden room, the game says: "There is a milk, a half of a bag of chips, a lettuce and a shovel on the floor." So the milk is on the floor. The user tried "take milk from floor," but the game said it couldn't find it. Maybe the correct command is just "take milk" because the milk is already on the floor, so the player can take it directly. Alternatively, maybe the player needs to pick it up from the floor, so the command should be "take milk from floor," but the game isn't recognizing it. However, the game's message says the milk is on the floor, so perhaps the player should just take it without specifying the location. Let me think about how TextWorld handles items. Usually, if an item is on the floor, you can take it by name, like "take milk." If it's in a container, you need to specify. Since the milk is on the floor, the correct command is likely "take milk." The user might have tried "take milk from floor" which is redundant, but the game might not accept that. So the next step should be to try "take milk" without the "from floor" part. That's probably the correct command here. The user needs to try that.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete a task. The goal seems to involve opening doors, retrieving items, and moving through different rooms.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Bathroom, and the next step after going north again would be to go south, which takes them back to the Kitchen. But the user's last action was going north from the Kitchen to the Bathroom, and now they're back in the Bathroom. The user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal.

The original task included resting the milk on the stove. The user picked up the milk in the Garden, went back through the Backyard, Kitchen, and Bathroom, but hasn't yet placed the milk on the stove. So the next logical step would be to go back to the Kitchen where the stove is located and put the milk there. However, the user is currently in the Bathroom, so they need to go south to return to the Kitchen. Once there, they can rest the milk on the stove. After that, the task is complete. But the user might have missed steps or might need to check if the stove is accessible. Since the Kitchen is the place with the stove, the correct action now is to go south back to the Kitchen and then place the milk on the stove.

-= Kitchen =-
Of every kitchen you could have sauntered into, you had to walk into an ordinary one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a closed refrigerator in the room. You can make out a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a kitchen island. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game, and they've been following a set of instructions to complete certain tasks. The main goal seems to be recovering the milk from the garden and then resting it on the stove. 

Looking at the current state, the user just came back to the kitchen after moving through several rooms. The score is at 9/22, which suggests they've completed most of the earlier steps but might be stuck somewhere. The last action was "go south," which took them back to the kitchen. 

Now, the user is at the kitchen again. The task mentioned was to rest the milk on the stove. The milk was picked up from the garden, so the next logical step is to find the stove and place the milk there. However, in the kitchen description, the stove is mentioned as being empty. The user has the milk in their inventory, so they need to go to the stove and put it down.

But wait, the user hasn't mentioned trying to interact with the stove yet. The previous actions were moving between rooms, so the next step should be to go to the stove. However, the kitchen description says the stove isn't occupied, so maybe the user needs to go to the stove's location and then rest the milk there. 

The user's last action was "go south," which brought them back to the kitchen. Now, they need to check if the stove is accessible and then place the milk on it. The correct command would be to go to the stove and then use the "put" command. But since the user is at the kitchen, they might need to interact with the stove directly. 

Looking at the previous steps, the user had to go east from the kitchen to the backyard, then south to the garden, pick up the milk, and then head back. Now, they're back in the kitchen. The next step is to rest the milk on the stove. So the command should be to go to the stove and then put the milk there. However, the game might require the user to first go to the stove's location. 

But in the current kitchen description, the stove is mentioned as being in the room. So the user can directly interact with the stove. The correct action would be to "rest milk on stove," but the exact command might be "put milk on stove" or "rest milk on stove." Since the game's previous commands used "rest," maybe that's the right verb here. 

Alternatively, the user might need to first go to the stove's location. But since the stove is in the kitchen, and the user is already here, they can proceed to rest the milk. So the next command should be "rest milk on stove."

That's not a verb I recognise.
