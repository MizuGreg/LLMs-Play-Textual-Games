Welcome to TextWorld! First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After pulling open the antique trunk, recover the old key from the antique trunk within the bedroom. Then, insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. And then, ensure that the wooden door is open. And then, make an effort to head east. After that, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. After that, go to the east. And then, make an attempt to take a trip south. Following that, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. If you have picked up the milk, venture north. And then, go west. And then, sit the milk on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. The room is well lit.

You can make out a chest drawer. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an antique trunk. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me figure out what the next step should be. The user has already opened the antique trunk and taken the old key. Then they tried to insert the key into the wooden door's lock. But the response was a bit confusing, maybe because the user didn't use the exact command format.

Wait, the previous action was "insert old key into wooden door's lock". The system response was a bit unclear, but the user is now asking if they're on the right track. The original goal was to unlock the door, so inserting the key into the lock is the next logical step. But maybe the correct command is "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with old key". However, the user's previous command was "insert old key into wooden door's lock", which might not be the exact syntax expected by the game. 

Alternatively, maybe after inserting the key, the door should automatically unlock. But the user's last action was inserting the key, and the system didn't confirm it. So the next step would be to try to open the door. The user needs to make sure the door is unlocked. So the next action should be to open the wooden door. Let me check the original instructions again. The user was told to "insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. And then, ensure that the wooden door is open." So after inserting the key, the door should be unlocked, then open it. But maybe the game requires the exact command. So after inserting the key, the next step is to open the door. So the next action should be "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has successfully unlocked the wooden door. The next step according to the original instructions was to ensure the wooden door is open. Since they just unlocked it, maybe they need to open it fully. But the game might require a specific command. The previous action was "unlock wooden door with old key", which worked. Now, the door is unlocked, so the next step is to open it. The correct command here would be "open wooden door". Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to "ensure that the wooden door is open" after unlocking. So after unlocking, they need to open it. The command "open wooden door" makes sense here. So the next action should be "open wooden door".

Okay, the user is in the Backyard and needs to proceed according to the original plan. The next step was to "make an effort to head east" after opening the screen door. But the user is now in the Backyard, and the next instruction was to "doublecheck that the screen door is wide open." Wait, the screen door was already opened earlier. Hmm, maybe the user needs to check if the screen door is open again. But the current location is the Backyard, and the screen door leads west back to the Kitchen. Alternatively, the next step might be to go south as per the exit mentioned. But the original plan after the backyard was to "take a trip south" from the garden (which is the Backyard). So the user should go south from here. The exit to the south is unguarded, so the command would be "go south".

Okay, the user is back in the Kitchen after going north and south, which seems like they're looping between rooms. The original goal was to "sit the milk on the stove." The user has the milk picked up from the Garden. Now, they need to get to the stove. The Kitchen has a stove mentioned, but it's described as empty. The user is holding the milk, so the next step is to go to the stove and put the milk there. The command should be "go to stove" or "go to stove area". But in the Kitchen, the stove is part of the room, so maybe "go to stove" is the correct command. Alternatively, since the user is in the Kitchen, they can directly interact with the stove. The previous steps have the user moving between rooms, but the milk needs to be on the stove. So the next action is to go to the stove and put the milk there. The correct command would be "go to stove" or "go to stove area". But the game might expect "go to stove" as the command.
