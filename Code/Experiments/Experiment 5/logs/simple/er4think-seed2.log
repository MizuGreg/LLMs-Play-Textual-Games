You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, assure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is wide open. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. After unlocking the wooden door, assure that the wooden door is wide open. After that, head east. Then, ensure that the screen door in the kitchen is open. Then, make an attempt to move east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to head south. Then, pick-up the lettuce from the floor of the garden. Then, travel north. Then, try to take a trip west. Then, rest the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a chest drawer. What's that over there? It looks like it's an antique trunk. Were you looking for a king-size bed? Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You see a closed refrigerator. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What's the point of an empty counter? You can see a stove. The stove is usual. The stove appears to be empty. You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Hmmm... what else, what else?

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has followed a series of steps to unlock and open doors, pick up items, and move around. The current task is to check if the actions so far are correct and if they're close to the goal. The user then needs to decide the next action.

First, I need to recap the steps taken. The player started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door east, then moved east to the kitchen. In the kitchen, they opened the screen door east. Now, the next step according to the original task was to attempt to move east after opening the screen door. But the user might be confused because the screen door is east, and after opening it, maybe they need to check if moving east is possible.

Looking at the kitchen description, after opening the screen door, the player is in the kitchen. The next step in the original task was to "make an attempt to move east." So the next action should be to go east. However, the user might have already done that, but the game's response after opening the screen door shows that the screen door is east, and the player is in the kitchen. So the next logical step is to try moving east from the kitchen. But the user's last action was opening the screen door, so the next command should be "go east" again. However, the user might need to check if that's possible. Alternatively, maybe the screen door is the only way to go east, so after opening it, moving through it would be the next step. But the game's response after opening the screen door says that the screen door is leading east, so the player can go through it. Therefore, the next action is to go east. However, the user might have already done that, but according to the task, after opening the screen door, the next step is to attempt to move east. So the correct next action is "go east".

-= Backyard =-
You're now in the backyard. You begin looking for stuff.

You make out a set of chairs. The set of chairs is ordinary. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Oh, great. Here's a bbq. The bbq appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well Look over there! a patio table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to rest the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. But the game doesn't recognize "rest lettuce on stove inside kitchen" as a valid command. Hmm, maybe the correct command is just "rest lettuce on stove" since the kitchen is the current location. Wait, but the user is in the garden now. Oh, right, they had to go back to the kitchen. Wait, the previous steps: they were in the garden, picked up the lettuce, went north to the backyard, then south back to the garden. Wait, maybe they need to go back to the kitchen. But how?

Wait, the original task said after picking up the lettuce in the garden, travel north, then try to take a trip west, then rest the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. So after picking up the lettuce in the garden, they went north to the backyard, then maybe west to the kitchen? But in the current state, the user is in the garden again. Maybe they need to go back to the kitchen. But how? The garden has an exit to the north (backyard) and the backyard has a screen door west leading back to the kitchen. So perhaps the correct path is: from the garden, go north to backyard, then west to kitchen, then rest the lettuce on the stove. But the user is currently in the garden, so they need to go north to backyard, then west to kitchen. But the user's last action was going south from the backyard back to the garden. So they need to go north again to get back to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can rest the lettuce on the stove. But the current location is the garden. So the next step should be to go north to the backyard. Then, from there, go west to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, rest the lettuce on the stove. But the user is in the garden, so the first action should be "go north" to reach the backyard. Then, from the backyard, "go west" to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, "rest lettuce on stove". But the user is in the garden, so the next command is "go north".

Okay, the user is trying to rest the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen. The previous attempt "rest lettuce on stove" wasn't recognized. Maybe the correct command is "put lettuce on stove" instead. Let me check the game's possible commands. In text adventures, common verbs are "put" instead of "rest". So the user should use "put lettuce on stove" instead. Let me confirm the kitchen description. The stove is present, so the action should be valid. Therefore, the next command is "put lettuce on stove".
