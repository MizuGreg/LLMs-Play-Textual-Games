I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, open the antique trunk. After that, take the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. Once you have picked up the old key, make it so that the wooden door is unlocked. After unlocking the wooden door, assure that the wooden door is opened. And then, make an attempt to go to the east. After that, look and see that the refrigerator is opened. After that, recover the lettuce from the refrigerator. If you can get your hands on the lettuce, put the lettuce on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A typical one.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the antique trunk. Eighty bucks?! That's ridiculous! Do you know my good friend, they work for the government? I'm sure my friend could get you one of those for 45 bucks! You can see a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a typical kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a refrigerator. You can make out a counter. The counter is standard. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. This always happens, here in TextWorld! What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps in the game. They opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. Now they opened the refrigerator and took the lettuce. The next step according to the original task was to put the lettuce on the stove.

So, the current location is the kitchen. The user has the lettuce. The next action should be to go to the stove. But how do they get there? The kitchen has a stove mentioned. The user is currently in the kitchen, so they need to go to the stove. The possible commands here are to go to the stove, but the game might require them to first go to the stove's location. Alternatively, maybe the stove is already in view, so they can put the lettuce there directly.

Looking at the previous steps, after opening the refrigerator and taking the lettuce, the next logical step is to go to the stove. The user has to move to the stove's location. The kitchen description mentions a stove, so the command should be "go to stove" or "go to stove". But in the game's context, the correct command might be "go to stove" or "go to the stove". However, the user's previous actions were using commands like "go east", so maybe the correct command here is "go to stove" or "go to the stove".

Alternatively, maybe the stove is already in the current room, so the user can directly put the lettuce on it. But the game might require moving to the stove's location first. The user's last action was taking the lettuce from the refrigerator, so now they need to go to the stove. The kitchen has a stove, so the next step is to go to the stove. Then, put the lettuce on it.

So the next command should be "go to stove" or "go to the stove". But the game might expect "go to stove" as the command. Let me check the previous commands. The user has been using "go east" and "open refrigerator". So the correct command here is "go to stove".

You can't see any such thing.
