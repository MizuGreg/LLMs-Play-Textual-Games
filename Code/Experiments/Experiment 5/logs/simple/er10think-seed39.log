It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to open the antique trunk. After pulling open the antique trunk, pick up the old key from the antique trunk. Then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, open the wooden door in the bedroom. Then, try to take a trip east. That done, open the refrigerator. And then, recover the apple from the refrigerator. After that, sit the apple on the stove within the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in a bedroom.

You can see a closed chest drawer. You see a closed antique trunk here. Were you looking for a king-size bed? Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. Now why would someone leave that there? The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.
