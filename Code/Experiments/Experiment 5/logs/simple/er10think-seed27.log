Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to look and see that the antique trunk is open. After that, pick up the old key from the antique trunk in the bedroom. After that, insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it. And then, ensure that the wooden door in the bedroom is open. After that, travel east. Okay, and then, doublecheck that the refrigerator is ajar. Then, take the milk from the refrigerator. Then, place the milk on the stove inside the kitchen. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You can see an antique trunk. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a king-size bed. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, and tried to insert it into the wooden door. But the system keeps saying "That's not a verb I recognise." Hmm, maybe the correct action isn't "insert" but something else like "use" or "try to open".

Wait, the user tried "insert old key into wooden door" but the system didn't recognize it. Then they tried "use old key on wooden door", which also didn't work. The problem might be that the game expects a specific command format. Maybe it's "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with old key". Alternatively, perhaps the door is locked, and the correct action is to "open the wooden door" after using the key.

Looking back at the original instructions, the user was told to "insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it." So maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" after inserting the key. But the game might require using the key on the door. Since the previous attempts with "use" didn't work, maybe the correct verb is "open" or "try to open".

Alternatively, maybe the key is already in the user's inventory, so the next step is to "open the wooden door". The user has already taken the key, so the next action should be to use it on the door. The system might be expecting "use old key on wooden door" but the game's parser doesn't recognize it. Maybe the correct command is "open wooden door" without mentioning the key, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, the user's last attempt was "use old key on wooden door", which the system rejected. Maybe the correct command is "use key on door" or "unlock door with key". But the game's context says the key is for the wooden door's lock. So perhaps the correct action is "unlock wooden door" or "open wooden door". Since the user has the key, maybe the game expects "open wooden door" after using the key. But the user hasn't tried that yet.

Alternatively, maybe the door is already locked, and the key is needed to open it. So the correct action is to "use old key on wooden door" but the system doesn't recognize "use". Maybe the game uses "try to open" or "open" as the verb. But the user has to figure out the right command. Since the user is stuck, maybe the next step is to try "open wooden door" without mentioning the key, but that might not work. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" with the key.

But the user's previous attempts with "use" didn't work. Maybe the game expects "insert key into door" or "put key in door". However, the original instruction said to "insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it." So perhaps the correct command is "insert old key into wooden door", but the system didn't recognize that. Wait, the user tried "insert old key into wooden door" earlier, and the system said it wasn't a recognized verb. Then they tried "use old key on wooden door", which also didn't work. Maybe the game expects "use old key on wooden door" but the system is strict. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "open wooden door" after using the key.

But the user hasn't tried that yet. So the next step would be to try "open wooden door" to see if that works. If that fails, maybe the user needs to try "unlock wooden door" or "try to open wooden door". However, based on the previous interactions, the user needs to find the right verb. Since the system is not recognizing "use", maybe the correct command is "open wooden door" or "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to progress in the game. They've opened the antique trunk, taken the key, and tried to unlock the door. The system keeps saying they need to open the wooden door first. But they already unlocked it with the key. Maybe there's a confusion between unlocking and opening. The user tried "go east" but the door isn't open yet. The previous attempt to "go east" failed because the door was still locked. The user needs to make sure the door is fully open after unlocking. Maybe the correct action is to "open wooden door" again, even though it's already unlocked. Or perhaps the game requires a different command. Since the user is stuck, the next step should be to try opening the door again, even if it's already unlocked, to proceed east.

You see a stove. The stove is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user has successfully unlocked the door and moved east to the kitchen. Their next goal is to check the refrigerator, which is closed. The previous attempt to "check refrigerator" showed it's closed. The next step should be to open it. The user needs to use the correct command to open the refrigerator. The possible commands could be "open refrigerator" or "use key on refrigerator", but since the key was already used to unlock the door, maybe the refrigerator can be opened directly. Wait, the user has the key from the trunk, but maybe the refrigerator is locked and requires the key. However, the initial problem was with the door, so maybe the refrigerator is just closed. The user should try opening it. The correct command would be "open refrigerator".
