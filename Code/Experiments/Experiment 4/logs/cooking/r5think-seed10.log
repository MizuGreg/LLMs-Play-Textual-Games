You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

Welcome to the kitchen.

You can see a fridge. The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a green apple, a green hot pepper and a white onion. You make out a closed oven close by. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato and a knife. You can see a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You move on, clearly upset with TextWorld.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe for Recipe #1 requires slicing the green bell pepper. But the user tried to slice it without a knife and was told they need a knife. Then they took the knife from the counter.

Now, the next step would be to use the knife to slice the green bell pepper. The user has the knife, so they should use it on the green bell pepper. The previous action was taking the knife, so the next logical step is to slice the pepper with the knife. The user is close to completing the recipe's first step. The goal is to prepare the meal, so this is a key part of the process. The user needs to make sure they slice the pepper correctly. Once that's done, the next steps would be frying it and preparing the meal. So the next action should be to slice the green bell pepper using the knife.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to slice the green bell pepper, then fry it, and then prepare the meal. So far, they've taken the green bell pepper from the fridge and sliced it. The next step according to the recipe is to fry the green bell pepper.

But in the game, the user tried "fry the green bell pepper" and it didn't work. Then they tried "fry the green bell pepper with the stove," which also didn't work. The error messages indicate that "fry" isn't a recognized verb. So maybe the correct action is to use the stove to cook the sliced pepper.

Wait, the recipe says "fry the green bell pepper," but in the game, the available actions might be different. The user has a stove in the kitchen. Maybe the correct command is to put the sliced pepper on the stove and then cook it. Alternatively, maybe the game expects a specific verb like "cook" or "heat" instead of "fry."

Looking back at the previous actions, the user used "slice the green bell pepper with the knife" which worked. So perhaps the correct next step is to use the stove to cook the sliced pepper. The game might require the user to specify the stove as the tool. So maybe the correct command is "put the sliced green bell pepper on the stove" or "cook the sliced green bell pepper on the stove."

Alternatively, since the recipe says "fry," maybe the game expects the user to use the verb "fry" with the stove. But since "fry" wasn't recognized, maybe the correct action is to use the stove to cook the pepper. The user might need to use the stove's function to cook the sliced pepper. So the next action should be to cook the sliced green bell pepper using the stove.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says after slicing and frying the green bell pepper, they need to "prepare meal". But the user is having trouble with the exact phrasing.

Earlier steps: They took the green bell pepper, sliced it with the knife, fried it on the stove. Now they need to "prepare the meal". The system is giving errors when they try to use "prepare meal" or "prepare the meal". Maybe the correct command is "serve the meal" or "eat the meal"? But the recipe says "prepare meal", so maybe the game expects a specific phrase. Alternatively, maybe "prepare the meal" is correct, but the user's previous attempt was missing the article. Let me check the previous interaction. The user tried "prepare meal with the green bell pepper" which was incorrect. Then "prepare the meal with the green bell pepper" also didn't work. The system might be expecting "serve the meal" or "eat the meal". But according to the recipe, it's "prepare meal". Maybe the game is strict with the wording. The user needs to use the exact phrase from the recipe. The recipe says "prepare meal", so the correct command is "prepare meal". But the user tried that before and got an error. Wait, in the previous step, the user tried "prepare meal with the green bell pepper" and the system said "I didn't understand that sentence". Then the user tried "prepare the meal with the green bell pepper" and got the same error. So maybe the correct command is just "prepare meal" without the "the" or the "with the green bell pepper" part. Since the green bell pepper is already prepared, maybe the next step is just "prepare meal". Alternatively, maybe "serve the meal" is the correct command. But the recipe says "prepare meal". The user needs to follow the recipe's exact instructions. So the next action should be "prepare meal".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. The recipe has four steps: slice the green bell pepper, fry it, prepare the meal. So far, they've managed to take the green bell pepper, slice it, fry it, and then try to prepare the meal. The last action was "prepare meal", which worked, adding the meal to their inventory.

Now, the user is asked if they think they're on the right track and close to the goal. The original goal was to cook a delicious meal, which they've done by following the recipe steps. The score increased each time they completed a step, so it seems like they've successfully completed all required actions. The next logical step would be to enjoy the meal, but the game might require them to consume it or maybe check if there's anything else. However, based on the previous interactions, once the meal is prepared, the goal is achieved. So the next action should be to eat the meal. But the available commands might be limited. Since the user has already prepared the meal, the final step is to take it and eat it. But in the game's context, maybe "eat the meal" is the command. However, the user might need to check if the meal is in their inventory and then consume it. But the previous action was "prepare meal", which added it to the inventory. So the next step is to eat it. But the game might not have an "eat" command. Alternatively, maybe the meal is now ready, and the user has completed the goal. But the user is prompted to say the next action. Since the score is at 4/10, maybe there are more steps, but according to the recipe, the steps are completed. So the correct next action is to eat the meal. But the game might require a specific command. The user previously used "prepare meal", which worked. So maybe the next step is to "eat the meal". However, the game might not have that command. Alternatively, the user might need to check if the meal is in the inventory and then take it. But the last action was preparing the meal, which added it to the inventory. So the next action should be to eat it. But since the user is supposed to only output the command, the answer would be "eat the meal".
