You've just shown up in a kitchen.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a white onion, a raw white tuna and a yellow onion. You make out a closed oven in the corner. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You see a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. But the thing is empty. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a kitchen game where they need to cook a meal. The cookbook says to use a white onion, chop it, roast it, and prepare the meal. The fridge has a white onion, raw tuna, and yellow onion. The oven is closed. The table has a cookbook and a knife. The stove is there but empty.

So far, the user tried to open the cookbook but couldn't, then looked around and at the cookbook. Now, after opening it, the recipe is clear. The next step is to get the white onion from the fridge. The user needs to take the onion, chop it with the knife, roast it in the oven, and then prepare the meal. The goal is to enjoy the meal, so following the recipe steps is key. The user is on the right track by following the cookbook's instructions. The next action should be to take the white onion from the fridge.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. So far, they've taken the white onion from the fridge and tried to chop it, but they forgot to use the knife. The knife is on the table, right? The cookbook says to chop the white onion, but they need the right tool.

Wait, the user tried to chop the onion but didn't specify using the knife. The game might require using the knife to chop. So the next step should be to take the knife from the table. Then, use the knife to chop the onion. But the user already took the onion. So maybe the next action is to take the knife first. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user took the white onion from the fridge. Then they tried to chop it, but the system asked what they want to chop it with. The user said "use knife", but the game said they can't see any such thing. Oh, maybe the knife is on the table. So the user needs to take the knife first. Then, use it to chop the onion. So the next action should be to take the knife from the table. Then, chop the onion with the knife. That makes sense. So the correct next step is to take the knife.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to chop the white onion using the knife. The previous attempt was "use knife to chop white onion", but the system said that's not a recognized verb. So maybe the correct command is just "chop white onion" without specifying the tool, assuming the knife is already in hand. Alternatively, maybe "cut white onion" is the right verb. Since the user has the knife, perhaps "chop" is acceptable. Let me check the previous steps. The user took the knife from the table, so now they have the knife. The correct command might be "chop white onion" again, as the system might accept that even if the knife isn't explicitly mentioned. Or maybe "cut" is the correct verb. Let me try "chop white onion" again.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the recipe from the cookbook. The recipe says to chop the white onion, roast it, and then prepare the meal. So far, they've taken the white onion from the fridge, chopped it with the knife, which worked. Now they're trying to roast the onion.

The problem is that the game doesn't recognize "roast" as a verb. Maybe the correct command is to use the oven. The user has a closed oven in the kitchen. So instead of saying "roast," they need to put the chopped onion in the oven. The oven is closed, so they might need to open it first. Let me check the previous steps.

Earlier, the user saw a closed oven. They haven't interacted with it yet. So the next logical step is to open the oven, then put the onion inside, and maybe close it. The game might expect the command "open oven" followed by "put onion in oven." But since the user is following the recipe's directions, which say "roast the white onion," the correct action here is to use the oven. So the next step should be to open the oven, then place the onion inside to roast it. The user might need to say "open oven" first, then "put white onion in oven." But since the game is expecting a single command, maybe "roast white onion" isn't the right verb, and the correct action is to use the oven. So the next command should be "open oven" to proceed.

The next step in the recipe is to roast the white onion. But the user tried saying "roast white onion" and got an error. Maybe the game expects a different command structure. Since they opened the oven, maybe they need to put the chopped onion inside and then close the oven to roast it. Alternatively, maybe "roast" needs to be combined with the oven. Let me check the previous steps.

Wait, after chopping the onion, the user tried "roast white onion" which didn't work. Then they opened the oven. So perhaps the correct action is to put the chopped onion in the oven. The game might require using the oven to roast the onion. So the next step would be to place the onion in the oven. The command might be "put white onion in oven" or something similar. But the user has already opened the oven, so maybe they need to put the onion inside. Let me think about the possible commands. The user has the knife and the onion. They need to roast the onion, which likely involves putting it in the oven. So the next action should be to put the chopped onion into the oven.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to cook a meal according to the recipe in the cookbook. So far, they've taken the white onion from the fridge, chopped it with the knife, roasted it in the oven, and followed the directions step by step. The recipe says to "roast the white onion" after chopping it. The user tried to roast it by putting it in the oven and closing it. Now, the next step would be to wait for the onion to roast, but since this is a text-based game, maybe the action is to "wait" or "let roast." However, the game might require a specific command. Alternatively, after roasting, the next step might be to prepare the meal, but the recipe only has those three steps. Wait, the recipe says "chop the white onion, roast the white onion, prepare meal." So after roasting, the user needs to "prepare meal." But the user is at the step of closing the oven. Maybe the next action is to "prepare meal" or "serve meal." But the user has to follow the directions exactly. The recipe's directions are three steps: chop, roast, prepare. So after roasting, the next step is to prepare the meal. But the user might need to check if the onion is ready. Alternatively, maybe "prepare meal" is the next command. But the user is in the kitchen, so maybe they need to take the roasted onion and make the meal. However, the game might require a specific action. Since the user has already roasted the onion, the next step is to "prepare meal," which could be a command. But the user's last action was closing the oven. So the next step would be to "prepare meal" or "serve meal." But the game might expect a specific verb. Let me check the previous steps. The user tried "roast white onion" but it was invalid. Then they opened the oven, put the onion in, closed it. Now, the next step is probably to "prepare meal" or "serve meal." But the recipe says "prepare meal" as the third step. So the correct next action is "prepare meal."

So far, they've taken the white onion from the fridge, chopped it with the knife, roasted it in the oven, and closed the oven. But the game says they still miss something.

Hmm, maybe they didn't follow the recipe correctly. Let me check the steps again. The recipe says "chop the white onion," which they did. Then "roast the white onion," which they did by putting it in the oven. The last step is "prepare meal." But maybe "prepare meal" requires something else. Wait, the recipe might need more ingredients. The initial ingredients listed were just white onion. But the user also saw a raw white tuna and yellow onion in the fridge. Maybe they need to use those? But the recipe only mentions white onion. Or maybe "prepare meal" needs another action, like serving or something else. Alternatively, maybe they need to check if the oven is properly closed and heated. But the game says they closed the oven. Wait, maybe they need to open the oven again to take the roasted onion out and use it in the meal. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step might be to open the oven again, take the onion out, and then proceed to prepare the meal. But the game says they still miss something. Alternatively, maybe they need to use the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, but it's empty. Maybe they need to heat something else. Wait, the recipe only has one ingredient. Maybe the user is missing a step in the recipe. Let me check the recipe again. The directions are: chop the white onion, roast the white onion, prepare meal. So after roasting, they need to prepare the meal. But how? Maybe they need to take the roasted onion from the oven and use it. But the game hasn't allowed them to do that yet. So the next action might be to open the oven again to take the onion out. But the user just closed the oven. So maybe the correct next step is to open the oven again. But the user hasn't done that yet. Alternatively, maybe the "prepare meal" step requires using the stove. But the recipe doesn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check if the oven is preheated. But the game doesn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the stove to cook something else. But the recipe only has the onion. Hmm. The user is at step 2/10, so they have two points. Maybe they need to take the roasted onion from the oven and then use it in the meal. So the next action would be to open the oven again. But the user just closed it. So the next step is to open the oven again. Let me check the previous steps. The user closed the oven after putting the onion in. So to take it out, they need to open the oven again. So the next action should be open oven. But the user hasn't done that yet.

So far, they've taken the white onion from the fridge, chopped it with the knife, roasted it in the oven, and now they've opened the oven to check on it. The next step according to the recipe is "prepare meal," but the system said they're missing something.

Wait, maybe they didn't use the correct ingredient. The recipe only lists white onion as an ingredient, but the fridge also has a raw white tuna. Maybe the meal requires both? Or perhaps "prepare meal" needs another step. But the recipe directions are pretty minimal. Alternatively, maybe "prepare meal" is a command that needs the oven to be closed again or something else. But the user just opened the oven, and the onion is already chopped and roasted. Maybe they need to take the roasted onion out of the oven and serve it. But the game might require a specific action. The previous steps were chopping, roasting, and now preparing. Since the oven is open, maybe they need to take the onion out. But the system didn't recognize "prepare meal" as a valid action. Maybe the correct next step is to take the roasted onion from the oven and serve it, but the game might have a specific command for that. Alternatively, maybe they need to close the oven again. But the user already closed it. Hmm. The last action was opening the oven, so maybe the next step is to take the onion out. But the game might not allow that. Alternatively, maybe "prepare meal" is the correct action, but the system said they're missing something. Maybe they need to use the stove? But the recipe doesn't mention the stove. Wait, the recipe says "roast the white onion," which is done. Maybe the meal is prepared, and the user just needs to eat it. But the game might require a specific command. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check if all steps are done. Since the recipe has three steps: chop, roast, prepare. They did chop and roast. The "prepare meal" is the next step, but the system said they're missing something. Maybe they need to use the stove for something else. But the recipe doesn't mention that.
