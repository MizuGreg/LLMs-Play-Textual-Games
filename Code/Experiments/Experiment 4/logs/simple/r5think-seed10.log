You are now playing a life changing round of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, make absolutely sure that the antique trunk is ajar. Then, retrieve the old key from the antique trunk. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. And then, look and see that the wooden door is open. And then, make an attempt to head east. And then, open the refrigerator inside the kitchen. If you have opened the refrigerator, pick up the lettuce from the refrigerator. And then, sit the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can see a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk, which looks usual, right there by you. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

You make out a refrigerator, so there's that. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What's the point of an empty counter? You can see a stove. The stove is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You make out a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been through the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, got the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east into the kitchen. The current location is the kitchen. The goal was to open the refrigerator, get the lettuce, put it on the stove.

In the kitchen, there's a refrigerator, a stove, a kitchen island with a note, and exits in four directions. The user's score is now 5/8. The next steps according to the initial instructions were to open the refrigerator, get the lettuce, then put it on the stove. 

So the next logical step is to open the refrigerator. The user hasn't done that yet. The current prompt says "Do you think you're making the right actions..." and then to say the next action. The user has already done the necessary steps to get to the kitchen, so the next command should be to open the refrigerator. Let me check the previous interactions. The user was told to open the refrigerator inside the kitchen. So the next action is to open the refrigerator.
