Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, ensure that the chest drawer inside the bedroom is open. After that, take the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. After picking up the old key, unlock the wooden door. If you have unlocked the wooden door, doublecheck that the wooden door is opened. And then, head east. After that, attempt to travel south. Then, retrieve the apple from the couch within the living room. And then, take a trip north. After that, place the apple on the stove within the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a bedroom.

You can see a chest drawer. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You make out a closed antique trunk. You can make out a king-size bed. Now why would someone leave that there? The king-size bed is ordinary. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens, here in TextWorld!

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the bedroom, trying to unlock the wooden door. They've already opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, and tried to unlock the door. The door is already unlocked, but maybe the game is checking if it's actually open. The message says "That's unlocked at the moment," so maybe the door is unlocked but not open. The user needs to open it before going east.

The user's goal is to eventually retrieve the apple from the living room and place it on the stove. So far, they've done the first steps: opening the chest, getting the key, unlocking the door. But the door might not be open yet. The game says "You have to open the wooden door first" when they try to go east, so even though it's unlocked, it's not open. So the next step should be to open the door. But the user already tried unlocking it with the key. Wait, maybe the door is locked and needs to be unlocked, but the key is already used. Or maybe the door is unlocked but needs to be opened manually. The game's response says "That's unlocked at the moment," so maybe the door is unlocked but not open. So the correct action is to open the door. But the user tried "unlock wooden door" again, which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "open wooden door" instead of "unlock". But the user has the key, so maybe they need to use "unlock" with the key. Wait, the previous action was "unlock wooden door" with the key, and the response was that it's unlocked. Maybe the door is now unlocked but not open, so the next step is to open it. But the available commands include "open ...", so perhaps the user needs to use "open wooden door" instead of "unlock". But the user already unlocked it. Hmm. The game might be expecting the user to open the door after unlocking. So the next action should be "open wooden door".

You can see a closed refrigerator, which looks usual, in the room. You can see a counter. The counter is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

You make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you make out a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

The low table is normal. On the low table you make out a remote, so there's that. You can see a tv. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a tv, go to TextWorld. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. Their goal is to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, went east into the kitchen, then south to the living room, took the apple from the couch. Now they need to go north from the living room.

The current room is the Living Room. The user just took the apple, and the next step according to the original instructions was to "take a trip north" after retrieving the apple. Then, place the apple on the stove in the kitchen. Wait, but they're in the living room now. So after taking the apple, they need to go north to the kitchen, then put the apple on the stove.

But looking at the room description for the Living Room, the exits are north (unblocked), and the kitchen was previously to the east. Wait, the user came from the kitchen (east) to the living room (south). So from the living room, going north would take them back to the kitchen. Then they can go west to the bedroom? Or maybe the kitchen is north of the living room. Wait, the kitchen was reached by going east from the bedroom, then south to the living room. So the living room's north exit would be back to the kitchen. So the user needs to go north from the living room to the kitchen, then put the apple on the stove.

But the user's last action was taking the apple from the couch. Now they need to go north to the kitchen. So the next command should be "go north". Then, once in the kitchen, they can put the apple on the stove. Let me check the kitchen description again. The stove is mentioned as being in the kitchen, and the user needs to place the apple on it. So after going north to the kitchen, the next step is "put apple on stove".

But the user's current location is the Living Room. The next step is to go north. So the correct command here is "go north".
