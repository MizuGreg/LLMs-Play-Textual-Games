Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First stop, ensure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is open. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. After that, make absolutely sure that the wooden door is unlocked. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After that, venture east. After that, move south. That done, take the bell pepper from the couch in the living room. Then, go north. Then, rest the bell pepper on the stove inside the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in the bedroom.

You can make out a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. However, the king-size bed, like an empty king-size bed, has nothing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the kitchen.

You see a closed refrigerator right there by you. You scan the room, seeing a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. Now they're in the kitchen, and the next step according to the original plan was to move south after going east. Wait, the user just went east from the bedroom, which led them to the kitchen. The current location is the kitchen. The next step in the original instructions was after venturing east, move south. But since they're already in the kitchen, maybe moving south from here is the next step.

Looking at the kitchen description, there's an exit to the north, a closed screen door east, an open wooden door west, and the possibility to go south. The user's next action should be to move south. But wait, the user's last action was going east, which brought them to the kitchen. The original plan said after going east, move south. So from the kitchen, moving south would be the next step. However, the kitchen's description mentions that south is unblocked. So the correct command here is 'go south'. Let me check the previous steps again. The user had to go east from the bedroom, then move south. So yes, in the kitchen, moving south is the next action. The user's next command should be 'go south'.

-= Living Room =-
You are in a living room. A normal kind of place.

Oh, great. Here's a couch. The couch is typical. On the couch you can see a bell pepper. You see a low table. You see a remote on the low table. You can make out a tv! The tv is usual. However, the tv, like an empty tv, has nothing on it. You move on, clearly upset with your TextWorld experience.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

Okay, the user is trying to rest the bell pepper on the stove, but the command isn't recognized. Let me check the possible actions in the kitchen. The previous steps were moving north back to the kitchen, then trying to rest the bell pepper. The error message says "rest bell pepper on stove" isn't a valid verb.

Maybe the correct command is "put bell pepper on stove" instead of "rest". Alternatively, the game might use "place" instead of "rest". Let me think about the available actions. The user had to take the bell pepper from the couch, so maybe the correct action here is to put it on the stove. Since "rest" isn't working, perhaps "put" is the right verb. Let me try that. The next action should be "put bell pepper on stove". If that doesn't work, maybe "place bell pepper on stove". But the user has to follow the correct syntax. The game might expect "put" as the verb. Let me go with "put bell pepper on stove".
