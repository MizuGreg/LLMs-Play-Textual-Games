I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, open the antique trunk. After that, take the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. Once you have picked up the old key, make it so that the wooden door is unlocked. After unlocking the wooden door, assure that the wooden door is opened. And then, make an attempt to go to the east. After that, look and see that the refrigerator is opened. After that, recover the lettuce from the refrigerator. If you can get your hands on the lettuce, put the lettuce on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A typical one.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the antique trunk. Eighty bucks?! That's ridiculous! Do you know my good friend, they work for the government? I'm sure my friend could get you one of those for 45 bucks! You can see a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a typical kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a refrigerator. You can make out a counter. The counter is standard. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. This always happens, here in TextWorld! What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps given in the task. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. Now they're in the kitchen, and the next step according to the task is to look and see that the refrigerator is opened. Wait, the current description says the refrigerator is closed. Wait, no, let me check again.

Looking at the latest prompt: In the Kitchen, the user sees a refrigerator, but the description says "closed" or "open"? Let me check the user's latest input. The user's last action was "go east", which led them to the kitchen. The description of the kitchen says: "There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded." Then it mentions the refrigerator as "closed" or "open"? Wait, the original description says: "If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a refrigerator. You can make out a counter. The counter is standard. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. This always happens, here in TextWorld! What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it."

Wait, the refrigerator is described as "closed" or "open"? The user's current location is the kitchen, and the task says after going east (to the kitchen), the next step is to "look and see that the refrigerator is opened." But in the current description, the refrigerator is not mentioned as open. Wait, maybe the user needs to open it. Wait, the task says: "After that, look and see that the refrigerator is opened." So perhaps the refrigerator is closed, and the user needs to open it. But in the current description, the refrigerator is not explicitly stated as open or closed. Wait, the user's latest prompt says: "You find yourself in a typical kind of place... There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded." Then, the refrigerator is mentioned as "closed" or "open"? Let me check again.

Looking back at the user's message after "go east": The description says "There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded." Then, the next part says: "If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a refrigerator. You can make out a counter. The counter is standard. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. This always happens, here in TextWorld! What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it."

So the refrigerator is described as "there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a refrigerator." But is it open or closed? The original task says "look and see that the refrigerator is opened." So maybe the user needs to open it. But in the current description, the refrigerator is not explicitly stated as closed. Wait, maybe the user needs to check if it's open. But according to the task, after going east, the next step is to look and see that the refrigerator is opened. So perhaps the user needs to open it. But how? The user might need to open the refrigerator. So the next action would be to open the refrigerator. But in the current description, the refrigerator is not mentioned as closed. Wait, maybe the user needs to check. Alternatively, maybe the refrigerator is already open, but the task says to look and see that it's opened. So the user needs to check. But the user's next action would be to open the refrigerator if it's closed. However, the current description doesn't say it's closed. Wait, maybe the user needs to open it. Let me think again.

The user's task steps after going east: "look and see that the refrigerator is opened." So the user needs to check if the refrigerator is open. If it's closed, they need to open it. But in the current description, the refrigerator is not explicitly stated as closed. However, in the kitchen description, the user is told that the refrigerator is there, but the status is not clear. However, in the initial description, the user is in the kitchen, and the refrigerator is mentioned. The user's next action would be to open the refrigerator. But the user might need to check if it's open. However, according to the task, the user needs to "look and see that the refrigerator is opened." So the user should check the refrigerator's state. But how? The user can try to open it. So the next action would be to open the refrigerator. But the user's current location is the kitchen, and the refrigerator is there. So the next action is to open the refrigerator. Therefore, the correct command is "open refrigerator".
