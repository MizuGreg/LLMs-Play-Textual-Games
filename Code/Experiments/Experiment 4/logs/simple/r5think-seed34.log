It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First step, open the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer in the bedroom. If you can get your hands on the old key, insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After that, travel east. Then, open the screen door. Then, go to the east. Then, attempt to travel south. If you can manage that, lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden. And then, head north. Then, try to travel west. Following that, rest the lettuce on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
Okay, so you're in a bedroom, cool, but is it standard? You better believe it is.

Hey, want to see a chest drawer? Look over there, a chest drawer. Oh, great. Here's an antique trunk. You see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has followed the steps given. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door. The next step according to the initial instructions was to ensure the wooden door is open, then travel east, open the screen door, go east again, try to travel south, pick up the lettuce, head north, travel west, and rest the lettuce on the stove.

Wait, after unlocking the door, the next logical step would be to open it. The user might have already unlocked it, but maybe they need to push it open. Then, travel east. Let me check the previous steps again. The user just unlocked the door, so the next action should be to open it. But the game might require explicitly opening it after unlocking. Then, proceed east. So the next command should be "open wooden door" to confirm it's open. Then "go east" to move to the next area. But the user's last action was unlocking the door, so the next step is to open it. Let me make sure. The user's score is at 3/4, so they need to continue following the steps. The next step after unlocking is to ensure the door is open, then go east. So the correct next action is "open wooden door".

Look at that placard! What does it say? It says Welcome to the kitchen? Well that's cool. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can see a closed refrigerator close by. You can make out a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well Were you looking for a kitchen island? Because look over there, it's a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

You see a toothbrush on the sink. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to reach the goal. So far, they've gone through the bedroom, unlocked the door, opened the wooden door, went east to the kitchen, then north to the bathroom, and back to the kitchen. The original goal mentioned was to lift the lettuce from the garden, rest it on the stove, and then proceed.

Looking at the current location, the user is back in the kitchen. The kitchen has a refrigerator, counter, stove, and a kitchen island with a note. The previous steps included opening the screen door east, but the user is now in the kitchen again. The next steps according to the initial instructions were to travel east, then attempt to travel south to the garden, lift the lettuce, head north, then west, and rest the lettuce on the stove.

Wait, in the current state, the user is in the kitchen. The next action should be to go east to open the screen door, then maybe go south from there to reach the garden. But the user has already gone east once before. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user's path so far: Bedroom -> unlock door -> open door -> go east to kitchen -> go north to bathroom -> go south back to kitchen. Now, the next step should be to go east again from the kitchen to open the screen door, which was mentioned in the initial instructions. Then, after opening the screen door, they need to go east again, then try to travel south to the garden. Once in the garden, lift the lettuce, then go north, west, and rest it on the stove.

So, the current location is the kitchen. The next command should be to go east to open the screen door. The user hasn't done that yet. The screen door is closed, so they need to open it. Then proceed east again to reach the garden. So the next action is "go east".

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to reach the goal. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, went east to the kitchen, then north to the bathroom, south back to the kitchen, opened the screen door. Now they're at the kitchen again with the screen door open.

The next step in the original instructions was after opening the screen door, go east. But the user just did that, and the screen door was opened. Now, according to the previous steps, after going east from the kitchen, they should attempt to travel south. Wait, the user is at the kitchen again. Let me check the original plan again.

Original steps: After opening the screen door, go east. Then, attempt to travel south. If successful, lift the lettuce from the garden, then head north, then west, then rest the lettuce on the stove.

Wait, but the user is in the kitchen. The screen door was opened, and they went east. But the screen door is leading east, so after opening it, the next step was to go east. But the user just did that, and now they're in the garden? Or maybe the screen door leads to the garden. Let me check the previous messages.

In the kitchen, there's a screen door leading east. So when the user opens the screen door and goes east, they would enter the garden. Then, the next step is to attempt to travel south from there. The original plan says after going east (from kitchen to garden), attempt to travel south. If that's possible, then lift the lettuce from the garden.

So the current location is the garden (after going east from the kitchen). The next action should be to go south. But the user is at the kitchen, so after opening the screen door and going east, they are in the garden. Then, the next step is to go south. But the user hasn't done that yet. Wait, the user's last action was opening the screen door, and the next step is to go east. But the user already did that. Wait, the user's last action was "go east" after opening the screen door. Then the system message says they are in the kitchen again? Wait, maybe there's a confusion here.

Wait, looking back: The user was in the kitchen, opened the screen door, then went east. The system message says "You open screen door. Your score... Then, the next prompt says "Do you think...?" and the user's next action was "go east". Then the system responds with "You have to open the screen door first." Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, no, the user had already opened the screen door. Maybe there's a mistake in the system's response. But according to the history, after opening the screen door, the user went east, which led them to the garden. Then, the next step is to attempt to travel south from the garden. So the correct next action would be to go south. But the user is in the garden now. So the next command should be "go south".

But the user is at the kitchen, and the system message says "You open screen door. Your score... Then, the next prompt says "Do you think...?" and the user's next action was "go east". Then the system responds with "You have to open the screen door first." Which is confusing because the user already opened it. Maybe there's a mistake in the system's message. But according to the game's flow, after opening the screen door, the user should go east to the garden. Then, from the garden, go south to lift the lettuce. So the next action after being in the garden is to go south. Therefore, the correct next command is "go south".

Look at you, bigshot, walking into a living room like it isn't some huge deal. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You see a couch. You see an apple on the couch. You make out a low table. The low table is typical. On the low table you see a remote. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a tv. The tv is standard. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an unguarded exit to the north.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete a goal. So far, they've opened a chest drawer in the bedroom, taken an old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went south again, and now they're in the living room.

The original goal mentioned in the initial prompt was to lift the lettuce from the garden, rest it on the stove, and then proceed through various rooms. But the current location is the living room, which doesn't mention a lettuce or a stove. Wait, the user had to go to the garden, lift the lettuce, then head north and west, and rest it on the stove. But so far, they've only moved through bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, and living room. The garden hasn't been mentioned yet. 

Wait, the user's steps so far include going east from the kitchen, which led to the living room. The next step in the original plan was after opening the screen door (which they did), then go east, then attempt to travel south. But in the current state, they're in the living room. Maybe the next step is to go north from the living room, but the living room's description says there's an unguarded exit to the north. However, the original plan mentioned after the kitchen, they should go east, then south. But maybe the user is off track. Alternatively, maybe the garden is another room they haven't explored yet.

Wait, the initial instructions said after opening the screen door, go east, then attempt to travel south. But in the current state, the user is in the living room. Maybe they need to go back to the kitchen, then south to the garden? Or perhaps the next step is to go north from the living room. But the original plan was to go east, then south. Hmm. The user might have made a mistake in the path. Alternatively, maybe the lettuce is in the garden, which is south of the kitchen. So after the kitchen, going south would lead to the garden. But the user is in the living room now. Maybe they need to go back west to the kitchen, then south to the garden. But the current location is the living room, which is north of the kitchen. So the user needs to go north from the living room to get back to the kitchen, then south to the garden. But the user's next action is to go north, which would take them back to the kitchen. But the original plan said after the kitchen, go east (screen door), then south. Maybe the user is following the correct path. But the lettuce is in the garden, so they need to get to the garden. So from the living room, going north would take them back to the kitchen, then south to the garden. But the user's next action is to go north. However, the user's current location is the living room, and the next step is to go north. But the original plan said after the kitchen, go east (screen door), then south. So perhaps the user is off track. Alternatively, maybe the garden is another room. But the user hasn't reached it yet. So the correct next step would be to go north from the living room back to the kitchen, then south to the garden. But the user's next action is to go north. However, the user's current step is in the living room, and the next action is to go north. But the original plan said after the kitchen, go east (screen door), then south. So maybe the user is supposed to go east from the kitchen (which they did, opening the screen door), then south. But in the current state, they are in the living room, which is north of the kitchen. So perhaps they need to go back to the kitchen, then south. But the user's next action is to go north, which would take them back to the kitchen. Then from the kitchen, go south to the garden. So the next action is to go north. But the user is in the living room, so going north would take them back to the kitchen. Then from the kitchen, go south to the garden.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete a goal. The current location is the Kitchen, and they've been moving around different rooms like Bedroom, Bathroom, Living Room, and back to Kitchen.

The original goal mentioned in the initial instructions was to lift the lettuce from the garden and then rest it on the stove. So far, the user has unlocked the door, opened the screen door, and moved through various rooms. But they haven't yet reached the garden or the lettuce. 

Looking at the current room (Kitchen), the user needs to find a way to get to the garden. The previous steps included going east from the Kitchen to the Living Room, then back to the Kitchen. The next logical step might be to check the south exit from the Kitchen, as that was mentioned as an unguarded exit. However, the user just tried going south and ended up back in the Kitchen, which might not be helpful.

Wait, the user is at the Kitchen again. The instructions mention that after opening the screen door and going east, they should attempt to travel south. But in the current state, the user is in the Kitchen, and the south exit is unguarded. Maybe the user needs to go south from the Kitchen to reach the garden. But the previous attempt to go south led them back to the Kitchen, so maybe there's a different path.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check the kitchen island for the note mentioned. The note might have clues about the garden or the lettuce. But the user hasn't interacted with the note yet. However, the current task is to follow the steps given in the initial instructions: after unlocking the door and opening the screen door, go east, then attempt to travel south. If that's possible, then lift the lettuce from the garden and rest it on the stove.

So, the next action should be to try going south from the Kitchen. The user tried that before but ended up back in the Kitchen. Maybe there's a different path. Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to go west from the Kitchen, but the wooden door is open. However, the initial steps mentioned going east, then south. So the user should follow that path again.

The user's last action was going north from the Living Room back to the Kitchen. Now, the next step is to go south from the Kitchen. The user needs to attempt to travel south, even if it's an unguarded exit. If that's possible, then they can proceed to the garden where the lettuce is. So the next command should be "go south".

The goal seems to involve collecting items and navigating through different rooms. So far, they've opened a chest drawer in the bedroom, taken an old key, used it to unlock a door, opened the door, and then moved through the kitchen, bathroom, and living room.

The current room is the Living Room, and the user is asked to decide their next action. The previous steps have been about moving between rooms and interacting with objects. The next step in the original instructions was to "lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden" after traveling south. But in the current scenario, the user is in the Living Room, which hasn't mentioned a garden or lettuce yet.

Wait, maybe the user has been moving in a loop between the kitchen and living room. The original plan was to go east, then south to the garden. But in the current state, the user is in the Living Room, which has an exit to the north (back to the kitchen) and possibly other directions. However, the garden hasn't been accessed yet. The user might need to find a way to get to the garden, which might be through another door or exit.

Looking at the previous steps, after the Living Room, the next possible direction was north back to the kitchen. But the original plan was to go south from the kitchen to the garden. However, in the current state, the user is in the Living Room, which might not have a direct exit to the garden. Maybe the garden is in a different part of the map. Alternatively, perhaps the user needs to check the items in the current room for clues. The Living Room has a couch, an apple, a remote, and a TV. The apple might be a red herring, but maybe the remote or TV has a function. However, the game's instructions didn't mention interacting with these items directly.

Alternatively, the user might need to go back to the kitchen and try another exit. The kitchen has a screen door east, which was opened earlier, and a south exit. Wait, in the previous steps, after opening the screen door, the user went south to the living room. Now, from the living room, going north brings them back to the kitchen. But the original plan was to go south from the kitchen to the garden. However, in the current state, the kitchen's south exit might not be available, or maybe the garden is accessible through another path.

Wait, looking back at the kitchen description: "There is an unguarded exit to the south." So from the kitchen, going south would lead to the garden. But the user is currently in the living room, which has an exit to the north (back to kitchen). So the next logical step would be to go back to the kitchen, then south to the garden. But the user is in the living room, so the next action should be to go north back to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, go south to the garden. However, the user's last action was going south to the living room, so now they need to go back north to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, go south to the garden. But the user's current position is the living room, so the immediate next action is to go north to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, go south to the garden. But the user hasn't reached the garden yet. The original plan was to go east, then south to the garden. But perhaps the garden is accessible from the kitchen's south exit.

So the correct next step is to go north back to the kitchen, then south to the garden. But the user is in the living room, so the next action is to go north. Then, from the kitchen, go south. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next command should be "go north" to return to the kitchen, then "go south" to reach the garden. However, the user is in the living room, so the immediate next action is "go north".

Look at that placard! What does it say? It says Welcome to the kitchen? Well that's cool. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can see a closed refrigerator close by. You can make out a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a loop between the Kitchen, Living Room, and Bathroom. The goal was to get the lettuce from the garden, but so far, the actions have been about opening doors and collecting the old key. The user has been moving east, west, north, south between rooms. The original instructions mentioned going to the garden, lifting the lettuce, then putting it on the stove. But the current location is the Bathroom, and the next step should be to find the garden.

Wait, the user hasn't gone to the garden yet. The previous steps were in the Kitchen, then Living Room, then Bathroom. The next logical step would be to go south from the Bathroom to exit to the garden. But the user is currently in the Bathroom, and the exit is south. So the next action should be "go south" to reach the garden where the lettuce is. But the user might have missed that part. Let me check the previous steps again.

In the Kitchen, there's an unguarded exit to the south. But the user has been going back and forth. The original plan was after unlocking the door, go east, open screen door, then go east again, then travel south to the garden. But the user might have gotten stuck in a loop. So the correct next step is to go south from the Bathroom to reach the garden. But the user is in the Bathroom, so "go south" would be the command.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete a goal. The current location is the Kitchen, and they've been moving between rooms like the Bedroom, Bathroom, Living Room, and back to the Kitchen. The goal mentioned earlier was to lift the lettuce from the garden and then rest it on the stove. But so far, the user hasn't encountered the garden or the lettuce yet.

Looking at the current room description, the Kitchen has a refrigerator, a stove, a counter, and a kitchen island with a note. The user has been moving between rooms, but the next step according to the original plan was to travel east after opening the screen door, then go to the east and attempt to travel south to the garden. However, the user hasn't gone east yet. The screen door is open, so maybe they need to go east from the Kitchen. But in the previous steps, after opening the screen door, the user went south, which led them back to the Kitchen. Wait, the screen door is leading east, so maybe the next logical step is to go east from the Kitchen through the screen door. But the user is currently in the Kitchen, so the next action should be to go east. However, in the last interaction, the user was in the Kitchen and the assistant suggested "go east", but the system responded that the screen door is open. Wait, the user might have already gone east and encountered the garden. But in the current state, the user is in the Kitchen again, so the next step should be to go east through the screen door. But the user hasn't done that yet. The original plan was after opening the screen door, go east, then attempt to travel south. So the next action should be to go east. But the user is currently in the Kitchen, so "go east" would be the next command. However, in the previous steps, the user went south from the Kitchen to the Living Room and back. So maybe the user needs to go east from the Kitchen again. The assistant's previous response was "go east", but the system might have a different setup. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from the Kitchen to the garden. Wait, the original plan said after opening the screen door, go east, then attempt to travel south. So perhaps the user is in the Kitchen, opens the screen door, then goes east to the garden, then tries to go south. But in the current state, the user is in the Kitchen again, so the next step is to go east. Therefore, the correct command is "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps in the game. They've already opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the door, opened the wooden door, went east to the kitchen, then north to the bathroom, back to the kitchen, then east to the backyard, and south to the garden. Now they're in the garden, where they need to lift the lettuce from the floor.

The user tried "lift lettuce from floor" but the system said that's not a recognized verb. Then they tried "take lettuce from floor" and got a response that they can't see any such thing. So the problem is that the correct command might be different. In text adventures, the usual verbs are "take", "get", "pick up", etc. Since "lift" isn't working, maybe "take" is the right verb. But the system said "can't see any such thing", which might mean that the lettuce isn't visible, but the description says there's a lettuce on the floor. Wait, the description says: "There is a milk, a lettuce, a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor." So the lettuce is there. Maybe the correct command is "take lettuce" without specifying "from floor" because the game might automatically know it's on the floor. Alternatively, maybe "pick up lettuce". But the user tried "take lettuce from floor" and it didn't work. The system's response was "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the game expects just "take lettuce" or "get lettuce". Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to "lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden." But the game might use different verbs. Since "take" is a common verb, maybe the correct command is "take lettuce". Alternatively, maybe "get lettuce". But the user tried "take lettuce from floor" and it didn't work. So perhaps the correct command is just "take lettuce". Let me try that.

Wait, the current location is the Garden. The next step after lifting the lettuce was to head north. So the next command should be "go north". But let me check the environment description again.

In the Garden, the description says: "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north." So the correct action here is to go north. The user has already taken the lettuce, so the next step is to move north. Then, after reaching the next room (which would be the Kitchen or another area), they need to go west and put the lettuce on the stove.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete the game by following the steps given. They've already collected the old key, unlocked the door, opened the screen door, and lifted the lettuce from the garden. Now, the next step was to rest the lettuce on the stove. But when they tried to do that, the system said it's not a recognized verb.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is different. In text adventures, sometimes you have to use specific verbs. Instead of "rest", maybe "put" is the right verb. So instead of "rest lettuce on stove", it should be "put lettuce on stove". Let me check the previous steps again. The user was told to "rest the lettuce on the stove" after lifting it. But the system might expect "put" instead of "rest". 

Also, the user is in the kitchen now after going north from the bathroom. The stove is in the kitchen. So the correct action would be to put the lettuce on the stove. The previous attempt used "rest", which wasn't recognized, so changing it to "put" should work. Let me confirm that "put" is the correct verb here. Yes, in many text games, "put" is used for placing items. So the next command should be "put lettuce on stove".
