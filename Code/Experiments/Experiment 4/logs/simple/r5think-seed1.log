Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, look and see that the antique trunk inside the bedroom is opened. Then, recover the old key from the antique trunk. Then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked. After unlocking the wooden door, open the wooden door in the bedroom. Then, try to head east. After that, try to travel south. Once you get through with that, take the milk from the couch within the living room. Having taken the milk, attempt to travel north. That done, rest the milk on the stove inside the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You make a grand eccentric entrance into a bedroom.

You see a closed normal looking chest drawer right there by you. You can see an antique trunk. You see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user has been following the steps given. So far, they've looked at the antique trunk, opened it to get the old key, and tried to unlock the wooden door. But the door is fixed, so maybe they need to use the key to unlock it.

Wait, the current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door is leading east. The user tried to unlock it but it was fixed. Maybe the key is needed to unlock it. Since they have the old key from the trunk, they should try using it on the door. The next logical step would be to use the key on the wooden door to unlock it. Then, after unlocking, they can open the door and proceed east as instructed. Let me check the previous steps again. The user had the key, so using it on the door makes sense. The next action should be to unlock the door with the key.

Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user has been following the steps given. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. Now they need to head east, then south, get the milk from the living room couch, travel north, and rest the milk on the stove in the kitchen.

After opening the wooden door, the next step was to try heading east. The user just opened the door, so the next action should be to go east. Let me check the previous steps to make sure. The last action was unlocking and opening the door, so the next command should be "go east". Then, after that, they need to go south. But first, they have to move east. The user is in the bedroom, just opened the door leading east. So "go east" is the next logical step. Then, once they are east, they can try going south. But the user's next action should be "go east" now.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock the door, and now they've opened the wooden door. The next step in the original instructions was to try to head east after opening the door. But the user tried to go east before opening the door and got a message saying they had to open the door first. Now that the door is open, the next action should be to go east. But the user's last action was opening the door, and the score increased. The next step according to the original plan is to try to head east. So the correct command here is "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. The room is well lit.

You make out a closed refrigerator nearby. You can see a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove. You see a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Well I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the living room.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a couch. You see a milk on the couch. You see a low table. The low table is standard. On the low table you see a remote. You scan the room for a tv, and you find a tv. The tv is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let me figure out the next step here. The user has been following the instructions to complete the game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, retrieved the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door in the bedroom, then went east to the kitchen, south to the living room. Now, in the living room, they need to take the milk from the couch as per the original goal.

The current location is the Living Room, and the milk is on the couch. The next step mentioned in the original instructions was "take the milk from the couch within the living room." So the next action should be to take the milk. After that, they need to travel north to the kitchen, then rest the milk on the stove. But since the user is at the living room now, the immediate next action is to take the milk. Let me check the previous steps to ensure I'm not missing anything. The user just arrived in the living room, and the milk is there. So the correct command is "take milk" or "take milk from couch". But according to the game's commands, it's likely "take milk" since the milk is on the couch. Wait, the description says "milk on the couch", so maybe the command is "take milk from couch". But the game might accept "take milk" alone. Let me check the previous interactions. Earlier, when the user took the old key from the trunk, they said "take old key". So maybe here, it's "take milk". But the couch is a location, so perhaps "take milk from couch". However, the game might have specific commands. Since the user is in the living room and the milk is on the couch, the correct action is to take the milk. So the next command should be "take milk".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. Their goal is to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door in the bedroom, went east to the kitchen, took the milk from the living room couch, and then went north back to the kitchen.

Now, the next step according to the original instructions was to rest the milk on the stove in the kitchen. The user just came back to the kitchen from the living room. The current location is the kitchen, and the milk is in their inventory since they took it from the couch. So the next logical step is to place the milk on the stove. The stove is mentioned as being in the kitchen, so they need to go to the stove and put the milk there. The command would be "put milk on stove" or something similar. But in the game's context, the exact command might be "rest milk on stove" as the user previously rested the milk on the stove. Wait, in the history, after taking the milk from the couch, they went north, which brought them back to the kitchen. The current room is the kitchen, and the stove is present. So the correct action is to rest the milk on the stove. The user's last action was "go north", which brought them back to the kitchen. Now they need to rest the milk on the stove. The game's previous response when they were in the kitchen mentioned the stove, so the next command should be to put the milk there. The correct command would be "rest milk on stove" or "put milk on stove". But looking at the previous interaction, when the user was in the kitchen after going south from the living room, they had to go north again. Now, they need to rest the milk on the stove. So the next action is to rest the milk on the stove. The user's last action was "go north", and now they need to perform that final step. So the answer should be "rest milk on stove".
