Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to ensure that the chest drawer is open. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. Then, make it so that the wooden door is ajar. And then, attempt to go to the east. Then, open the screen door. And then, travel east. With that done, make an effort to travel south. And then, retrieve the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. Then, make an attempt to move north. With that accomplished, head west. With that done, place the half of a bag of chips on the stove. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
You've seen better bedrooms, but at least this one seems pretty normal.

You see a chest drawer. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. A closed antique trunk is nearby. You can make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me try to figure out what the user needs here. They're playing a text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete a task. The current situation is in the Bedroom, and they've already unlocked the wooden door east. The next steps mentioned in the original instructions were to attempt to go to the east, then open the screen door, travel east again, go south, retrieve the half bag of chips from the garden, move north, head west, and place the chips on the stove.

But the user is stuck at the point where they've unlocked the door, and the system is prompting for the next action. The previous action was "unlock wooden door with old key", which worked. Now, the next logical step would be to go through the door. However, the user might not know the exact command format. The system message says to only output the action, like "go north".

Looking at the environment description, after unlocking the door, the player should be able to go east. The door is now ajar, so the next command should be "go east". But the user might have tried "door is ajar" which wasn't a valid command. The system corrected that. So the correct next step is to move east through the door. The user needs to input "go east" to proceed. Then, after that, they might need to open a screen door, but that's after moving east. So the immediate next action is "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in the text adventure game. Their goal is to eventually retrieve the half bag of chips from the garden and complete the tasks mentioned.

So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, went east to the kitchen, then north to the bathroom, and back south to the kitchen. The current location is the kitchen again, with the same description. The score is at 5/9.

The next step in the original plan was to travel south from the kitchen, but that's already been done. Wait, no, the original instructions said after getting the key, unlock the door, make it ajar, go east, open the screen door, travel east, then go south to the garden. But in the current state, they're in the kitchen again. Maybe they need to go east again through the screen door. The kitchen has a closed screen door leading east. So the next logical step would be to open that screen door. Once open, they can go east into the garden. Then, from the garden, they need to retrieve the half bag of chips and move north to the stove. But the user hasn't reached the garden yet. So the immediate next action should be to open the screen door in the kitchen. Let me check the previous steps again.

In the kitchen, the user is at 5/9. The next action after going south back to the kitchen would be to open the screen door east. Then go east to the garden. Then retrieve the chips, move north to the stove, etc. So the correct next command is "open screen door".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the door, opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, then south to the garden. In the garden, they need to retrieve the half of a bag of chips from the floor. But when they tried to take it, the game said they can't see any such thing.

Hmm, maybe the chips are not directly visible? The description mentions "a half of a bag of chips, a tomato plant, a milk and a shovel on the floor." So the chips are there, but perhaps the user needs to look closer or use a different action. The previous action was "take half of a bag of chips from floor," which didn't work. Maybe the correct command is just "take half of a bag of chips" without specifying the floor? Or maybe "pick up half of a bag of chips"?

Alternatively, maybe the game expects the player to first check the floor more carefully. But the user already saw the items on the floor. Wait, the user's last action was trying to take the chips from the floor, but the game responded that it can't see them. Maybe the chips are not on the floor but somewhere else? But the description says they are on the floor. Maybe the correct command is "take half of a bag of chips" without the "from floor" part. Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to "retrieve the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden." So the correct action should be taking it from the floor. But the game didn't recognize it. Maybe the command should be "take half of a bag of chips from the floor" again, but the user already tried that. Or perhaps the game requires a different phrasing. Maybe "get half of a bag of chips" or "pick up half of a bag of chips." Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look around again. But the user is supposed to follow the instructions. Since the game's response was that they can't see it, maybe the correct action is to take it directly. Wait, the user's last attempt was "take half of a bag of chips from floor," which failed. Maybe the correct command is just "take half of a bag of chips" without specifying the floor. Let me think. The game's message said "there is a half of a bag of chips, a tomato plant, a milk and a shovel on the floor." So the chips are on the floor. The user needs to take them. The previous command was "take half of a bag of chips from floor," but the game said can't see. Maybe the correct command is "take half of a bag of chips" without the "from floor" part. Or maybe the game expects "pick up" instead of "take." Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use the correct object name. The game might have specific terminology. Let me check the previous commands. The user was told to "retrieve the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden." So the correct action is to take it from the floor. But the game didn't recognize it. Maybe the user needs to use the exact phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the game is case-sensitive. Let me check the exact wording. The user wrote "take half of a bag of chips from floor." The game's message says "can't see any such thing." Maybe the correct command is "take half of a bag of chips" without the "from floor" part. Or maybe the user needs to look for it again. But the user is supposed to follow the instructions. Since the user is in the garden, and the chips are on the floor, the next step is to take them. The previous attempt failed, so maybe the correct command is "take half of a bag of chips" without the "from floor." Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "get" instead of "take." But the user's last action was "take half of a bag of chips from floor," which didn't work. Maybe the game expects "take half of a bag of chips" without the "from floor." Let me try that. So the next action should be "take half of a bag of chips."

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. They've already completed several tasks like opening the chest drawer, taking the key, unlocking the door, and moving through different rooms. Now they're in the Backyard again, and the goal is to eventually retrieve the half bag of chips and put it on the stove.

Wait, the user previously tried to take the half bag of chips from the floor in the Garden, but the game said they couldn't see it. Then they took it again, and it worked. Now they're back in the Backyard, and the next step is to go north again. But the current location is the Backyard, and the Garden is to the north. However, the user's last action was going north from the Backyard, which led them back to the Garden. But in the Garden, there's a tomato plant, milk, and shovel on the floor, but the half bag of chips is already taken. Wait, no—the user took the half bag of chips from the Garden floor earlier, so maybe that's already done.

The next step in the original plan was to "place the half of a bag of chips on the stove." The stove is in the Kitchen. So the user needs to get back to the Kitchen. But currently, they're in the Backyard. The path back to the Kitchen would be through the screen door west to the Kitchen, then maybe through the open door west from the Kitchen to the Bedroom, but that seems like a longer route. Alternatively, from the Backyard, going south would take them back to the Garden, then north to the Backyard again. Hmm, maybe there's a more direct way.

Wait, in the Backyard, there's an open screen door leading west, which connects back to the Kitchen. So the user should go west from the Backyard through the screen door to the Kitchen. Then, from the Kitchen, they can go north to the Bathroom, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, from the Kitchen, they can go west through the open door back to the Bedroom, but that's not helpful either. The stove is in the Kitchen, so once in the Kitchen, they can go to the stove and place the chips there.

But the user is currently in the Backyard. So the next step should be to go west through the screen door to the Kitchen. Then, from the Kitchen, go to the stove. But the user's last action was going north from the Backyard, which didn't help. So the correct next step is to go west from the Backyard to the Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, they can go to the stove and place the chips. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next command should be "go west" from the Backyard.

You can see a closed toilet. You see a bath. You can see a sink. On the sink you can see a toothbrush.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in the TextWorld game. Their goal is to complete a set of tasks: open the chest drawer, take the old key, unlock the door, open the door, go east, open the screen door, travel east, go south, retrieve the half bag of chips, move north, then west, and finally place the chips on the stove.

So far, the user has reached the bathroom after going north from the kitchen. The current location is the bathroom, and the next step mentioned in the original instructions was to "place the half of a bag of chips on the stove." But in the current scenario, the user is in the bathroom, which doesn't have a stove mentioned. The previous steps had the user in the kitchen, then the garden, then the backyard, etc. 

Wait, the last action was going north from the kitchen to the bathroom. The user is now in the bathroom. The next logical step would be to check if the stove is in the kitchen, but the user is in the bathroom. However, the original task was to place the chips on the stove. The stove is in the kitchen, so the user needs to go back to the kitchen. 

But the user's current location is the bathroom. The exit to the south is unblocked, so going south would take them back to the kitchen. Once in the kitchen, they can then go north again to the backyard, but the task is to place the chips on the stove, which is in the kitchen. So the correct next step is to go south from the bathroom back to the kitchen, then proceed to the stove. However, the user's last action was going north to the bathroom, and the current prompt is in the bathroom. The user needs to go south to the kitchen. 

But the user's last action was "go north" to the bathroom, and now they need to go south back to the kitchen. So the next command should be "go south" to return to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, they can go north again to the backyard, but the task is to place the chips on the stove, which is in the kitchen. So after returning to the kitchen, they can go to the stove and place the chips there. 

But the user's current location is the bathroom, so the immediate next step is to go south to the kitchen. Therefore, the correct command is "go south".
