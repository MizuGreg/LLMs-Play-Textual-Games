Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to doublecheck that the antique trunk is opened. Then, recover the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. Having taken the old key, insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it. After that, look and see that the wooden door is ajar. And then, travel east. With that over with, ensure that the screen door is open. And then, attempt to move east. After that, make an attempt to go south. With that accomplished, lift the apple from the floor of the garden. After that, make an attempt to take a trip north. Then, go to the west. With that over with, put the apple on the stove. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

You find yourself in a bedroom. An ordinary one.

Oh, great. Here's a chest drawer. You make out an antique trunk. Huh, weird. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game called TextWorld. The goal seems to be a series of specific actions they need to follow. Let me recap the steps they've taken so far.

First, they were in the bedroom and found an antique trunk. They opened it and took an old key. The score increased each time they completed a step. The next step in the initial instructions was to insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. Then, after unlocking, they needed to check if the door is ajar, move east, ensure the screen door is open, move east again, try to go south, pick up an apple from the garden, take a trip north, go west, put the apple on the stove, and then stop.

So far, the user has completed the first two steps: opening the trunk and taking the key. The next step according to the instructions is to insert the key into the wooden door's lock. The current location is the bedroom, and there's a closed wooden door leading east. The user needs to use the old key to unlock it. 

The user's next action should be to use the key on the door. The command would be "use old key on wooden door" or something similar. But in the game's context, the correct command might be "unlock wooden door with old key" or "insert old key into wooden door". However, based on the previous commands the user used ("open antique trunk", "take old key from antique trunk"), the next logical step is to use the key on the door. 

The user's previous actions were "open antique trunk" and "take old key from antique trunk". The next step is to insert the key into the door's lock. The correct command here would be "use old key on wooden door" or "unlock wooden door with old key". But since the game might expect a specific syntax, maybe "insert old key into wooden door". However, the user's previous commands were more about interacting with objects directly. 

Looking at the initial instructions: "insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it." So the action is to insert the key into the door's lock. The correct command here would be "insert old key into wooden door". But the user might need to first approach the door. However, in the current location, the wooden door is already present. So the next step is to insert the key into the door's lock. 

Therefore, the next action should be "insert old key into wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. The goal is to follow a series of steps to reach the original goal, which I assume is to complete all the tasks mentioned in the initial instructions.

So far, the player has opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, tried to insert it into the wooden door (but that didn't work at first), then unlocked the door with the key. Then they went east, but were told to open the door first, which they did. Now they're at the door, opened, and moving east.

The next step in the original instructions was to "ensure that the screen door is open. And then, attempt to move east." Wait, but after opening the wooden door, the player is now in the next room. Maybe the "screen door" refers to another door they need to open before moving east? Or maybe the wooden door they just opened is the screen door?

Alternatively, maybe after moving east, they need to check if the screen door is open. But the current room is the bedroom, and after opening the wooden door (which leads east), they move east. The next step in the original plan was to move east, then try to go south, then lift the apple in the garden, etc.

But the user's last action was "go east", which was blocked because the door was closed. Then they opened the door and went east. Now they're in the next room. The next step in the original instructions was to "ensure that the screen door is open. And then, attempt to move east." Wait, maybe after moving east, they need to open a screen door? Or maybe the screen door is part of the current room?

Alternatively, maybe the screen door is a different door. But the current room is the bedroom, and after moving east, they might be in a room with a screen door that needs to be opened. However, the user's last action was moving east, and the next step is to check if the screen door is open. But the user hasn't mentioned a screen door yet.

Looking at the available commands, the player is in the room east of the bedroom. The original instructions said after moving east, attempt to move south. So maybe the next step is to go south from the current location. But the user's last action was moving east, and the next step is to check if the screen door is open. However, the user might have already moved east, so the screen door could be in that new room.

Alternatively, maybe the screen door is the wooden door they just opened. But the user has already opened it. Maybe the screen door is a different door. The original instructions mention "ensure that the screen door is open" before moving east. But the user just moved east after opening the door. So perhaps the screen door is the same as the wooden door, and they need to make sure it's open, which they did.

In any case, the next step according to the original plan is to "attempt to move east" after ensuring the screen door is open. But the user has already moved east. Maybe the next step is to go south from the current location. The original instructions said after moving east, attempt to go south. So the next action should be "go south".

But the user is in the room east of the bedroom. The original goal mentions moving to the garden, lifting the apple, then going north, west, etc. So perhaps the next step is to go south from the current room. The user's last action was moving east, so the next command should be "go south".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the old key, tried to insert it into the door, which didn't work at first. Then they unlocked the door with the key, opened it, and went east into the kitchen.

Now, in the kitchen, there's a refrigerator, a counter, a stove, a kitchen island with a note, a screen door east, a wooden door west, and exits north and south. The user's next action was to go south, but that was blocked. Then they tried going east again.

The current room is the kitchen. The goal was to lift the apple from the garden, put it on the stove, and then go north, west, etc. But in the kitchen, there's no apple mentioned yet. The note on the island might be important. The user needs to find the apple, which was in the garden. So maybe they need to go through the screen door east, check the garden, find the apple, take it, then go back to the stove. But the user is in the kitchen now. The screen door is closed, so they need to open it. Then go east to the garden, take the apple, come back, put it on the stove, and proceed.

So the next step would be to open the screen door east. Then go east to the garden. But the user is in the kitchen. The screen door is closed, so they need to open it first. Then go east. So the next action should be open screen door.

Wait, the original goal said to lift the apple from the garden. Maybe the garden is another room. But the user is in the backyard now. Maybe they need to go south from here to reach the garden. The backyard has an unguarded exit to the south, so perhaps that's where the garden is. So the next step would be to go south to the garden, then pick up the apple. Then return to the kitchen, put the apple on the stove, and proceed with the rest of the steps. But the user's last action was going east to the backyard. Now, they need to check the south direction. So the next command should be 'go south' to move to the garden where the apple is located.

The current room is the garden, and the user needs to lift the apple from the floor. The original goal mentioned was to lift the apple from the garden's floor and then put it on the stove. So far, the user has reached the garden and found the apple there. The next step would be to take the apple. But the user's last action was "go south", which led them to the garden. Now, they need to pick up the apple. The command should be "take apple from floor" or something similar. However, in the game's context, the correct command might be "take apple" since the apple is on the floor. Let me check the available commands again. The user can use "take apple from floor" if that's the exact phrasing. But in previous steps, they used "take old key from antique trunk", so maybe here it's "take apple from floor". But the garden's description says "there is a tomato plant, a milk, an apple and a shovel on the floor." So the apple is on the floor. Therefore, the correct command is "take apple from floor". But the user's next action should be to take the apple. However, the user's last input was "go south", which brought them to the garden. Now, they need to take the apple. So the next command should be "take apple from floor".

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Garden scene. The previous action was looking at the apple, and the system responded that the apple looks appetizing. The user's next step should be to take the apple. But wait, in the previous attempt, when they tried to take the apple from the floor, it didn't work. But now, maybe after looking at it, they can take it.

Wait, the user's last command was "take apple from floor", which resulted in "You can't see any such thing." But then they did "look at apple", which worked. So maybe the apple is now visible. So the correct command would be "take apple from floor" again? Or maybe "take apple"?

But in the game's context, sometimes you have to specify "from floor" if it's on the floor. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "take apple from floor" and it failed, but after looking at it, maybe it's now possible. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is just "take apple".

Wait, the user is in the Garden, and the description says "There is a tomato plant, a milk, an apple and a shovel on the floor." So the apple is on the floor. So the correct command would be "take apple from floor". But earlier, that command didn't work. But after looking at it, maybe the game allows taking it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "take apple" without specifying "from floor".

But in the previous attempt, "take apple from floor" didn't work. However, after looking at the apple, maybe the user can now take it. So the next action should be "take apple from floor" again. Or perhaps "take apple".

Alternatively, maybe the game requires the user to use "take apple" without the "from floor" part. Let me think. In TextWorld, sometimes you have to use the correct syntax. For example, if the apple is on the floor, you might need to say "take apple from floor" or "take apple". But in the previous attempt, "take apple from floor" didn't work. However, after looking at the apple, maybe the game now recognizes it. So the user should try "take apple" again.

But the user's last action was "look at apple", which made the apple visible. So perhaps the next step is to take the apple. So the correct command would be "take apple".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game as instructed. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked the door, and moved east to the kitchen. Then they opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, and now they're in the garden. They took the apple from the floor.

The next step according to the original plan was to "attempt to move east" after taking the apple. But in the current scenario, the user is in the garden. Let me check the available commands and the current room description.

In the Garden room, the description mentions that there's an unguarded exit to the north. The user has the apple in their inventory now. The next step mentioned in the original instructions was to "take a trip north" after putting the apple on the stove. Wait, but the user hasn't put the apple on the stove yet. Wait, the original instructions said: "Once that's all handled, lift the apple from the floor of the garden. After that, make an attempt to take a trip north. Then, go to the west. With that over with, put the apple on the stove."

Wait, the user has already lifted the apple. Now, the next step was to try to go north. But in the current Garden room, the available exits are north and south. The user needs to go north first. So the correct next action would be to go north. But let me check the current room's description again. The Garden room says: "You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north." So the user should go north. Then, after that, go west, then put the apple on the stove.

So the next action should be "go north".

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. A normal kind of place.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a set of chairs. The set of chairs is usual. But the thing is empty. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a bbq. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You can make out a patio table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The patio table is typical. The patio table appears to be empty.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to put the apple on the stove. But in the current room, which is the backyard, there's a patio table mentioned, but no stove. Wait, earlier they were in the kitchen where there was a stove. But now they're in the backyard. So maybe the stove is in the kitchen, and the user is in the backyard now. So putting the apple on the stove isn't possible here because the stove isn't here. The user needs to go back to the kitchen to put the apple on the stove. So the next action should be to go west through the screen door back to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can put the apple on the stove. But the current room is the backyard, so the correct command would be to go west to return to the kitchen.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a refrigerator. You make out a counter. The counter is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You can see a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.
