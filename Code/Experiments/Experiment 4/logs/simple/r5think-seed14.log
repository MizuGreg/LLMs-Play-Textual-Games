It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First step, doublecheck that the antique trunk in the bedroom is wide open. After that, pick up the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door inside the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door is open. Then, move east. Then, try to head south. Then, pick up the milk from the couch. Then, make an effort to travel north. Then, put the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a bedroom, but I guess I was wrong.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You can make out a closed antique trunk. Hey, want to see a king-size bed? Look over there, a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. The king-size bed appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the TextWorld game. They started by checking the antique trunk in the bedroom, which was closed. Then they opened it and found an old key. They took the key, and now they're at step 2/4.

The next step according to the original task is to unlock the wooden door inside the bedroom with the old key. So the next action should be to unlock the door. But how do you do that in the game? The user has the key, so they need to use it on the door. The command would likely be something like "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But the game's commands might be more straightforward. Since the door is closed and the key is in hand, the correct command is probably "unlock wooden door".

Wait, the user has to make sure the door is unlocked and then open it. So first, unlock it with the key, then open it. The current step is to unlock the door. So the next action is to unlock the wooden door with the old key. The correct command would be "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door". But in the game's context, maybe just "unlock wooden door" is sufficient. Let me check the previous actions. The user opened the trunk, took the key. Now they need to unlock the door. So the next command is "unlock wooden door".

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen.

You see a refrigerator. You make out a counter. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can see a stove. The stove is ordinary. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. This always happens! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

-= Living Room =-
You find yourself in a living room. A normal one.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a couch. On the couch you can make out a milk. You make out a low table. On the low table you make out a remote. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a tv. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the task. So far, they've checked the antique trunk, opened it, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door in the bedroom, then moved east to the kitchen, went south to the living room. Now, in the living room, they need to pick up the milk from the couch. The next step according to the original instructions is to pick up the milk from the couch. The user has to do that next. Then, after picking up the milk, they need to travel north and put the milk on the stove. So the immediate next action is to pick up the milk. The command should be "take milk from couch" or something similar. But looking at the previous actions, the user used "take old key from antique trunk", so maybe the correct command here is "take milk from couch". The system's response in the living room mentions that the milk is on the couch, so the user needs to take it. Then, after that, go north to the kitchen again (since the kitchen was previously north of the bedroom, but now the living room is north of the kitchen?), wait, the current location is the living room. The exits in the living room are north. So after taking the milk, the next step is to go north to the kitchen, then put the milk on the stove. But the user's next action should be to take the milk. So the correct command here is "take milk from couch".
