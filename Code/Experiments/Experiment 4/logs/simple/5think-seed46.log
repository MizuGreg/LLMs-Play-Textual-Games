Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be great if you could make sure that the antique trunk is opened. After that, pick up the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked. After unlocking the wooden door, doublecheck that the wooden door is wide open. Then, try to go to the east. With that accomplished, ensure that the refrigerator within the kitchen is open. And then, retrieve the milk from the refrigerator inside the kitchen. And then, rest the milk on the stove. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A normal kind of place.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You scan the room for a king-size bed, and you find a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, picked up the old key, unlocked the wooden door in the bedroom, and tried to go east. But the door is still closed, and they can't proceed.

The user is now asking if they're making the right moves and if they're close to winning. They also want the next action. Let me recap the steps required:

1. Open the antique trunk.
2. Pick up the old key from the trunk.
3. Unlock the wooden door in the bedroom.
4. Ensure the door is wide open.
5. Go east.
6. Open the refrigerator in the kitchen.
7. Retrieve milk from the fridge.
8. Rest the milk on the stove.
9. Win.

So far, the user has done steps 1-3. They tried to go east but couldn't because the door was still closed. The next step should be to open the door fully. The user tried to check the door but didn't open it. The game message said the door is robust and the lid is in the way. So maybe they need to push the door open after unlocking it.

Wait, the user just tried to go east, but the game said they need to open the door first. So the next logical step is to open the door. But how? They have the key, so maybe they need to use it to open the door. But they already unlocked it. Maybe the door is locked but not yet open. So after unlocking, they need to open it. The game might require them to open the door manually after unlocking.

So the next action should be to open the wooden door. Let me check the previous steps. The user tried to check the door, but the game didn't allow moving east until the door is open. So the correct next step is to open the door. The user might need to use the key again or just push it open. Since the door was unlocked, maybe they can open it by pushing. So the next command should be to open the wooden door.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a refrigerator. You see a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing is empty. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island. Now that's what I call TextWorld!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, picked up the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, went east to the kitchen, opened the refrigerator, took the milk. Now they need to rest the milk on the stove.

The error message says "That's not a verb I recognise." So the command "rest milk on stove" isn't valid. Hmm. In TextWorld, commands are usually verbs that directly correspond to actions. "Rest" might not be a valid verb here. Maybe the correct action is to put the milk on the stove. Let me check the available actions in the kitchen. The kitchen has a stove, so perhaps the correct command is "put milk on stove" or "place milk on stove". Alternatively, maybe "rest" is a valid verb in this context, but the game doesn't recognize it. Since the user tried "rest milk on stove" and it didn't work, the next step is to try a different verb. The correct action would likely be "put" instead of "rest". So the next command should be "put milk on stove".
