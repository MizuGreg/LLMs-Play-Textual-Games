Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, open the chest drawer. Then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After pulling open the wooden door, take a trip east. And then, make sure that the screen door is wide open. After that, make an effort to move east. With that done, attempt to take a trip south. Then, pick-up the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. And then, attempt to go to the north. If you can succeed at that, make an effort to take a trip west. And then, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a chest drawer. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a closed antique trunk close by. Look over there! a king-size bed. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.

You see a refrigerator. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the refrigerator. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. You wonder idly who left that here. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps given in the original task. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. The current location is the kitchen, and the score is at 5/6.

The next step in the original task was to make sure the screen door is wide open. The user is in the kitchen, and the description mentions a closed screen door leading east. So the next action should be to open the screen door. 

Wait, the user's last action was "go east", which led them to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the screen door is closed. The task says after opening the wooden door, they need to make sure the screen door is wide open. So the next step is to open the screen door. Then, after that, they need to attempt to move east again. But the screen door is east, so maybe after opening it, they can go east again. But the current prompt says the screen door is closed, so the user needs to open it first. 

So the correct next action is to open the screen door. Then, after that, they can go east. But according to the task, after making sure the screen door is open, they should attempt to move east again. But the user is in the kitchen now. Let me check the original steps again.

Original steps: After pulling open the wooden door, take a trip east. Then, make sure the screen door is wide open. Then, attempt to move east. So after opening the wooden door (which they did), they went east to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, they need to make sure the screen door is open. The screen door is closed here, so they need to open it. Then, after that, they can try moving east again. So the next action is to open the screen door.

You've entered a backyard. You can barely contain your excitement.

You scan the room for a set of chairs, and you find a set of chairs! The set of chairs is typical. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? What's that over there? It looks like it's a bbq. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a bbq, go to TextWorld. However, the bbq, like an empty bbq, has nothing on it. You can see a patio table. The patio table is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial task. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. They opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden where they picked up the bell pepper. Now they're back in the backyard after going north again.

The original goal was to pick up the bell pepper in the garden and then rest it on the stove. The user has already done the first part: picking up the bell pepper in the garden. The next step mentioned was attempting to go north, which they did, but now they're back in the backyard. The next action needed is to go south back to the garden to rest the bell pepper on the stove. However, the current location is the backyard, so the correct direction would be south to return to the garden. Once there, they can rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the user's last action was going north, which brought them back to the backyard. So the next step should be going south to the garden again. Then, rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next command should be 'go south' to return to the garden, then 'rest the bell pepper on the stove'. But according to the instructions, the user should only output the next action. Since they're in the backyard now, the next step is to go south to the garden. So the answer is 'go south'.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to rest the bell pepper on the stove. But in the current location, the Garden, the description mentions a half of a bag of chips, an apple, and a shovel on the floor. There's no mention of a stove here. The stove was in the Kitchen earlier, but the user is now in the Garden.

So the problem is that the stove isn't present in the Garden. The user tried to put the bell pepper on the stove, but since the stove isn't here, it's not possible. The correct action would be to go back to the Kitchen where the stove is located. The user needs to move north to get back to the Kitchen. Then, they can place the bell pepper on the stove there. But the user's last action was in the Garden, so the next step should be to go north to the Kitchen. Once there, they can put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user hasn't moved north yet. So the next command should be "go north" to reach the Kitchen and then proceed to put the bell pepper on the stove.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete the game's objectives. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden. In the garden, they picked up the bell pepper. The next step was to rest the bell pepper on the stove, but the game says the stove isn't visible.

Wait, in the garden description, there's a half bag of chips, an apple, and a shovel on the floor. No mention of a stove. But the user tried to put the bell pepper on the stove, which isn't there. So maybe the stove is in the kitchen? But when they were in the kitchen, the stove was described as having nothing on it. Maybe the stove is in the kitchen, but the user is in the garden now. So they need to go back to the kitchen to put the bell pepper on the stove. But the current location is the garden. The previous steps had them go from garden to backyard to garden again. So maybe the correct path is to go north back to the backyard, then west through the screen door to the kitchen, then put the bell pepper on the stove there. But the user is stuck because they can't see the stove in the garden. So the next action should be to go north to the backyard, then west to the kitchen, then put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user's last action was going north again, which led them back to the backyard. So the next step would be to go west through the screen door to the kitchen.

You arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.

You see a refrigerator. You check the price tag that's still affixed to the refrigerator. 100 bucks? What a deal! You'll have to ask where they got this! You see a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look over there! a kitchen island. You wonder idly who left that here. The kitchen island is usual. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a chest drawer. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The chest drawer is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a closed antique trunk close by. Look over there! a king-size bed. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is an open wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete a series of tasks in this TextWorld game. They've been moving through different rooms, collecting items, and following specific steps. The main goal seems to involve moving through various rooms and possibly interacting with objects like the bell pepper and the stove.

The user is currently in the Kitchen, and the last action was going east, which led them back to the Kitchen. The current score is 9/20, so they have a few more steps to go. The original goal mentioned picking up the bell pepper and resting it on the stove. However, in the Garden, when they tried to put the bell pepper on the stove, they couldn't see the stove. Maybe the stove is in a different location, like the Kitchen.

Looking at the current room (Kitchen), there's a mention of a stove, but it's described as having nothing on it. The user might need to interact with the stove here. Since they have the bell pepper, perhaps they need to go back to the Garden, but the stove isn't there. Wait, maybe the stove in the Kitchen is the correct one. The user might have forgotten that the stove is in the Kitchen. They need to put the bell pepper on the stove in the Kitchen. But earlier, when they were in the Garden, they tried to put it on the stove and couldn't see it. Maybe the stove is in the Kitchen, so they need to go back there.

But the user is currently in the Kitchen. The previous attempt to put the bell pepper on the stove failed because they were in the Garden. So, they need to go back to the Garden, pick up the bell pepper again, and then go to the Kitchen to put it on the stove. However, the user might have already picked up the bell pepper in the Garden. Wait, the last action was in the Garden, where they picked up the bell pepper. Now, they need to go to the Kitchen to put it on the stove. But the stove is in the Kitchen. So the correct action would be to go north from the Garden to the Kitchen and then put the bell pepper on the stove.

But the user is currently in the Kitchen, so maybe they need to go west to the Bedroom, then east back to the Kitchen, but that seems redundant. Alternatively, maybe the stove is in the Kitchen, and they just need to use the correct command. The error message said "You can't see any such thing" when trying to put the bell pepper on the stove in the Garden, which suggests the stove isn't there. So the stove must be in the Kitchen. Therefore, the user should go to the Kitchen (which they are already in) and try putting the bell pepper on the stove. But they have the bell pepper, so maybe the command is "put the bell pepper on the stove" in the Kitchen. However, the user was in the Garden when they tried that, which was incorrect. So the correct path is to go from Garden to Kitchen and then put the bell pepper on the stove there.

But the user is currently in the Kitchen, so perhaps they need to just try the command again here. The previous failure was in the Garden, but if they are in the Kitchen now, maybe the stove is present. So the next action should be to put the bell pepper on the stove in the Kitchen. However, the user might not have the bell pepper here. They picked it up in the Garden, so they need to go back to the Garden, pick it up again (but they already have it), and then go to the Kitchen. Wait, but in the Garden, the bell pepper is on the floor. So the user has it, and now they need to go to the Kitchen to put it on the stove. So the next step is to go north from the Garden to the Kitchen and then put the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is currently in the Kitchen, so maybe they need to go back to the Garden, but that's not necessary. Alternatively, maybe the stove is in the Kitchen, and the user can just put the bell pepper there. The confusion is because the user tried to put it in the Garden where there's no stove. So the correct action is to go to the Kitchen and put the bell pepper on the stove. Therefore, the next command should be "put the bell pepper on the stove" in the Kitchen. But the user is in the Kitchen now, so that's the right place. However, the previous attempt in the Garden failed, but here in the Kitchen, maybe it works. So the answer is to put the bell pepper on the stove.
