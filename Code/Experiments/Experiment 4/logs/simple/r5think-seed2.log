You are now playing a exciting game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First stop, assure that the chest drawer in the bedroom is wide open. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. After unlocking the wooden door, assure that the wooden door is wide open. After that, head east. Then, ensure that the screen door in the kitchen is open. Then, make an attempt to move east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to head south. Then, pick-up the lettuce from the floor of the garden. Then, travel north. Then, try to take a trip west. Then, rest the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a chest drawer. What's that over there? It looks like it's an antique trunk. Were you looking for a king-size bed? Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You see a closed refrigerator. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What's the point of an empty counter? You can see a stove. The stove is usual. The stove appears to be empty. You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Hmmm... what else, what else?

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has followed a series of steps to unlock and open doors, pick up items, and move around. The current task is to check if the actions so far are correct and if they're close to the goal. The user then needs to decide the next action.

First, I need to recap the steps taken. The player started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door east, then moved east to the kitchen. In the kitchen, they opened the screen door east. Now, the next step according to the original task was to attempt to move east after opening the screen door. But the user might be confused because the screen door is east, and after opening it, maybe they need to check if moving east is possible.

Looking at the kitchen description, after opening the screen door, the player is in the kitchen. The next step in the original task was to "make an attempt to move east." So the next action should be to go east. However, the user might have already done that, but the game's response after opening the screen door shows that the screen door is east, and the player is in the kitchen. So the next logical step is to try moving east from the kitchen. But the user's last action was opening the screen door, so the next command should be "go east" again. However, the user might need to check if that's possible. Alternatively, maybe the screen door is the only way to go east, so after opening it, moving through it would be the next step. But the game's response after opening the screen door says that the screen door is leading east, so the player can go through it. Therefore, the next action is to go east. However, the user might have already done that, but according to the task, after opening the screen door, the next step is to attempt to move east. So the correct next action is "go east".

-= Backyard =-
You're now in the backyard. You begin looking for stuff.

You make out a set of chairs. The set of chairs is ordinary. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Oh, great. Here's a bbq. The bbq appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well Look over there! a patio table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table.

There is an open screen door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the original task. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. They opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden. In the garden, they picked up the lettuce.

Now, the next step according to the original task was to travel north from the garden. The user's last action was picking up the lettuce, so the next command should be to go north. The score is at 9/10, so they need to complete the remaining steps. After traveling north, they need to try to take a trip west, then rest the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen. But the current location is the garden, so the immediate next action is to go north. The assistant should output "go north" as the next command.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to rest the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen. But in the current location, which is the garden, there's no stove mentioned. The previous steps had them go from the garden back to the backyard, then back to the garden. The stove is in the kitchen, which was earlier in the sequence.

So the problem is that the user is in the garden, but the stove is in the kitchen. They need to go back to the kitchen first. The correct action would be to go north to return to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can rest the lettuce on the stove. But since the current location is the garden, the next step should be to go north to the kitchen. The user might have tried to rest the lettuce without being in the kitchen, which is why the command wasn't recognized. So the next action should be to go north to the kitchen.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to rest the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen. They tried "rest lettuce on stove" but got an error. The problem is that the command isn't recognized. Maybe the correct verb is "put" instead of "rest". In text adventures, "put" is commonly used for placing items. So the correct command should be "put lettuce on stove". The user might have used "rest" by mistake. Let me check the previous steps to confirm. Earlier, they picked up the lettuce, so now they need to put it on the stove. The kitchen is accessible via the west door from the backyard. So the next step is to go back to the kitchen, then use "put" instead of "rest".

Hmm, maybe the stove is not in the current location. The user is in the Garden now, and the stove is in the Kitchen. So they need to go back to the Kitchen. Let me check the previous steps.

Earlier, they went from Garden to Backyard to Garden again. The stove is in the Kitchen, which is west of the Backyard. So the correct path is to go west from Backyard to Kitchen, then interact with the stove. But the user is currently in the Garden. Wait, the user is in the Garden, so they need to go north to Backyard, then west to Kitchen. Once in the Kitchen, they can put the lettuce on the stove. But the user hasn't gone back to the Kitchen yet. So the next step should be to go north to Backyard, then west to Kitchen. But the user is in the Garden, so first go north to Backyard, then west to Kitchen. Then, once in the Kitchen, they can put the lettuce on the stove. But the user's last action was in the Garden. So the next command should be "go north" to reach Backyard, then "go west" to Kitchen. But the user might not have tried that yet. So the correct next action is "go north" to get back to Backyard, then "go west" to the Kitchen. But the user is in the Garden, so first "go north" to Backyard. Then "go west" to Kitchen. Then "put lettuce on stove". But the user is currently in the Garden, so the immediate next step is "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete a series of tasks in the TextWorld game. So far, they've managed to open the chest drawer, pick up the old key, unlock and open the wooden door, go east to the kitchen, open the screen door, go east again to the backyard, then south to the garden where they picked up the lettuce. Now they need to rest the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen.

The problem is that when they tried "rest lettuce on stove," the game didn't recognize it. Then they tried "put lettuce on stove," but that also didn't work. The user is now back in the backyard, and the next action is to go north again. But they need to get the lettuce to the stove in the kitchen. 

Wait, the lettuce is in the garden. The user is in the backyard, which is adjacent to the garden. But the kitchen is in the kitchen area. So maybe the user needs to go back to the kitchen. But the previous steps had them go from the garden to the backyard, then back to the garden. The user is stuck trying to get the lettuce to the stove. 

The correct action here is probably to go back to the kitchen. But how? The user is in the garden, which has an exit to the north (backyard) and the kitchen is probably accessible from the backyard. Wait, earlier when they were in the garden, they could go north to the backyard. Then from the backyard, they can go west through the screen door back to the kitchen. So the user needs to go back to the kitchen, then put the lettuce on the stove. 

But the user is currently in the backyard, so the next step should be to go west through the screen door to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can put the lettuce on the stove. However, the user's last action was "go north" again, which took them back to the backyard. So the next step should be to go west to the kitchen. 

But the user is in the backyard, and the screen door is open leading west. So the correct command is "go west" to return to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, they can put the lettuce on the stove. 

So the next action should be "go west" to get back to the kitchen, then "put lettuce on stove" or "rest lettuce on stove" again. But since the game didn't recognize "rest," maybe "put" is the correct verb. However, the user tried "put" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "put lettuce on stove" in the kitchen. 

But the user is in the backyard, so they need to go west to the kitchen first. Therefore, the next action is "go west."

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete a series of tasks in the TextWorld game. So far, they've managed to open the chest drawer, pick up the old key, unlock and open the wooden door, go east to the kitchen, open the screen door, go east again to the backyard, then south back to the garden where they picked up the lettuce. Now they need to rest the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen.

The user tried "rest lettuce on stove" but got an error. Then they tried "put lettuce on stove" and got "You can't see any such thing." So, maybe the stove isn't in the current location. The user then went north again, ending up in the backyard, and then tried "go west" to return to the kitchen.

Now, in the kitchen, the user is at the kitchen again. The stove is mentioned as being in the kitchen. The problem might be that the user hasn't picked up the lettuce yet, but they were in the garden and picked it up. Wait, the last action was going west to the kitchen. So, the lettuce is in the user's inventory. The stove is in the kitchen. So the correct command should be to put the lettuce on the stove. But the previous attempts failed. Maybe the correct verb is "put" instead of "rest"? Or maybe the command is "put lettuce on stove". But the user tried "put" and got "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the stove is not in the current room? Wait, the kitchen has a stove. So perhaps the user needs to go to the stove's location. But in the kitchen description, the stove is mentioned as being there. So maybe the correct command is "put lettuce on stove". But the system says "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the stove is not visible, or the user needs to interact with it differently. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "put lettuce on the stove". The user might need to use the preposition "on the" instead of "on". But the game's parser might be strict. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first go to the stove. But in the kitchen, the stove is present. So the correct action is "put lettuce on stove". But the user tried that and got an error. Maybe the game expects "put" without "on"? Or maybe the stove is not in the current room. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is there. So the command should be "put lettuce on stove". But the system says "You can't see any such thing." Maybe the stove is not in the current room. Wait, the kitchen description says: "You can see a stove. The stove is usual. The stove appears to be empty." So the stove is present. Therefore, the correct command should be "put lettuce on stove". But the user tried that and got an error. Maybe the game expects "put the lettuce on the stove". But the user can't say "the" because the game might not accept articles. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "put lettuce on stove". But the system says it's not recognized. Maybe the user needs to use "put" as a verb, but the game expects "put" followed by the object and the location. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first go to the stove. But in the kitchen, the stove is already there. So the correct action is "put lettuce on stove". But the system is not recognizing it. Maybe the user should try "put lettuce on the stove". But the game might not accept "the". Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "place" instead of "put". But the user tried "rest" and "put". So perhaps the correct command is "put lettuce on stove", but the game's parser is not recognizing it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "put" without "on", but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to use "put" followed by the object and the location. But the system is not accepting it. The user is stuck here. The next step is to try "put lettuce on stove" again, but the system says it's not recognized. Maybe the correct command is "put lettuce on stove". But the user has to try it again. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go to the stove first. But in the kitchen, the stove is already there. So the correct action is "put lettuce on stove". The user has to try that again.
