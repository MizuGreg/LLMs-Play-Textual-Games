Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to look and see that the antique trunk is open. After that, pick up the old key from the antique trunk in the bedroom. After that, insert the old key into the wooden door inside the bedroom's lock to unlock it. And then, ensure that the wooden door in the bedroom is open. After that, travel east. Okay, and then, doublecheck that the refrigerator is ajar. Then, take the milk from the refrigerator. Then, place the milk on the stove inside the kitchen. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You can see an antique trunk. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a king-size bed. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, and tried to insert it into the wooden door. But the game didn't recognize "insert" as a valid command. The user then tried "use old key on wooden door," which also didn't work.

Hmm, in text-based games, the commands are usually more straightforward. Instead of saying "insert," maybe the correct action is to "unlock" the door with the key. Or perhaps "use" the key on the door. Wait, the user tried "use old key on wooden door" and got an error. Maybe the game expects a different phrasing, like "use key on door" or "unlock door with key."

Looking back at the previous steps, the user had to pick up the key from the trunk, then insert it into the lock. The correct command might be "use old key on wooden door" but the game didn't recognize it. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the key is for the lock. So the action should be "unlock wooden door with old key" or something similar.

Wait, the user's last attempt was "use old key on wooden door," which the game didn't recognize. The error message says "That's not a verb I recognise." So maybe the correct verb is "unlock" instead of "use." Or perhaps the game expects "open" the door with the key. But the door is locked, so "unlock" makes more sense.

Alternatively, maybe the key is for the lock, so the action is "unlock the door" using the key. The correct command might be "unlock wooden door" if the key is already in hand. But the user has the key, so maybe just "unlock wooden door."

Wait, the user has the key, so the next step is to use it on the lock. The game might expect "use key on lock" or "unlock door with key." But the door is described as "wooden door inside the bedroom's lock," so maybe the correct action is "unlock wooden door."

But the user tried "use old key on wooden door" and it didn't work. Maybe the game expects "unlock wooden door" without specifying the key. Or maybe the key is already in the inventory, so the command is just "unlock wooden door."

Alternatively, the game might require the player to "open" the door with the key. But the door is locked, so "open" might not be the right verb. The correct action is likely "unlock wooden door."

So the next step would be to try "unlock wooden door." That's the most logical command here. The user needs to unlock the door with the key they have. Let's go with that.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in a text-based game. Their goal is to open the antique trunk, get the key, use it to unlock the door, go east, check the fridge, get milk, and put it on the stove.

So far, they've opened the trunk, taken the key, tried to insert it into the door, and managed to unlock it. But when they tried to go east, the game said they need to open the door first. They tried unlocking it again, but it's already unlocked. Now, they're stuck at the door, unable to proceed east.

Wait, maybe the door is locked but they've already unlocked it. Or maybe "unlock" is the correct action, but the game is expecting "open" instead. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "insert old key into wooden door" which didn't work, then "use old key on wooden door" which was invalid. Then they tried "unlock wooden door" which worked, but the door is now unlocked. However, the game says they have to open it first. Maybe the door is locked but they've unlocked it, so they need to open it. But if it's already unlocked, maybe "open" is the correct verb here. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and they need to use the key to open it, but they already did that.

Wait, the user's last action was "unlock wooden door" which was successful. The game says "That's unlocked at the moment." So the door is unlocked. But the user can't go east unless the door is open. Maybe "open" is the correct action here, even though it's already unlocked. Or maybe the door is locked, and they need to use the key again. But the key was used to unlock it. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the user needs to open it, but the key is already in the lock. So the correct action is to "open the wooden door" even though it's unlocked. The game might be expecting that. So the next step is to try opening the door, even though it's already unlocked. Let me check the previous messages. The user tried "go east" and the game said they need to open the door first. So maybe the door is locked, and even though they unlocked it, they need to open it. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and the user needs to use the key again to open it. But they already did that. This is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to "open" the door instead of "unlock" it. Since the door was locked, they needed to unlock it, but now it's unlocked, so they need to open it. But the game might be using "open" as the correct verb here. So the next action should be "open wooden door".

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a refrigerator. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a stove. The stove is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to complete the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the key, unlocked the door, and then went east to the kitchen. Now they've opened the refrigerator, taken the milk, and the next step is to place the milk on the stove.

The current location is the kitchen. The previous action was taking the milk from the refrigerator. The next logical step would be to go to the stove and put the milk there. The user needs to move to the stove, which is in the kitchen. The command should be "go to stove" or "go to stove in kitchen". But since the game might expect a specific command, maybe "go to stove" is sufficient. Let me check the previous commands. The user has been using "go east" and "look at" commands. The correct action here is to place the milk on the stove, so first, they need to go to the stove's location. The stove is mentioned as being in the kitchen, so the command would be "go to stove" or "go to stove in kitchen". But the game might require just "go to stove". Alternatively, maybe "go to stove" is the correct command. The user has to move to the stove's location first, then put the milk there. So the next action should be "go to stove".
