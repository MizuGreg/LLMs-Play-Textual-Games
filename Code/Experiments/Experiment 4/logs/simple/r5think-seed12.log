I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk. After that, make it so that the wooden door in the bedroom is unlocked with the old key. And then, make absolutely sure that the wooden door inside the bedroom is ajar. After opening the wooden door, go east. Then, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. And then, attempt to travel east. And then, try to travel south. With that done, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After stealing the milk, head north. And then, attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a chest drawer. You scan the room for an antique trunk, and you find an antique trunk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You think about smashing the king-size bed to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and tried to make it ajar. But the system didn't recognize "ajar" as a verb, so they tried "unlock" again, which worked but maybe wasn't the right action.

The user is now asking if they're on the right track and what their next move should be. The goal is to eventually get the milk from the garden, so they need to proceed through the door. The current step is to make sure the wooden door is ajar. Since "ajar" isn't a valid command, maybe the correct action is to open the door instead. But the door is already unlocked. Alternatively, maybe "push" or "open" is the correct verb here. The user tried "unlock" again, which might not be the right action. The system's response after "ajar" was that it's not a recognized verb, so they need to use the correct command. The next step after unlocking is to open the door, so the correct command would be "open wooden door". Then, after that, go east as instructed. So the next action should be to open the door.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game, and they've been following a set of steps to complete a task. The current scenario is in the Kitchen after opening the screen door. The original goal was to go through various rooms, open doors, retrieve items, and eventually rest the milk on the stove.

So far, the user has opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, gone east to the kitchen, opened the screen door. Now they're in the kitchen, and the next step according to the original instructions was to double-check that the screen door is wide open, then travel east, then try to travel south. But after opening the screen door, the user is in the kitchen. The next action would be to go east again, but the screen door is already open. Wait, the user just opened the screen door, so maybe they need to check if it's open. But the prompt says "doublecheck that the screen door is wide open" before traveling east. So maybe the user needs to confirm the screen door is open, then go east. But the user just opened it, so maybe they can proceed to go east. However, the next step in the original plan was after opening the screen door, go east, then travel east again, then south. But in the current state, the user is in the kitchen, and the screen door is open. So the next step would be to go east again. But the user might need to check if the screen door is open first. However, the user already opened it, so maybe they can proceed. The next command would be "go east" again. But in the kitchen, there's a screen door leading east, which is open. So the user can go east through that door. Then, after that, they need to try to travel east again (maybe to another room) and then south. But the user's current location is the kitchen, and the screen door is open. So the next action is to go east. The user's last action was opening the screen door, so the next step is to go east. The assistant should respond with "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps given in the original task. They've been moving through different rooms, opening doors, and collecting items. The current location is the Garden, where they need to lift the milk from the floor.

The user has tried "take milk from floor" multiple times, but each time it's been unsuccessful. The game's response is "You can't see any such thing." That suggests that the milk isn't visible or maybe isn't actually there. Wait, but the description of the Garden says: "There is a milk, a half of a bag of chips, a lettuce and a shovel on the floor." So according to the game's description, the milk is present. But when the user tries to take it, it's not working. Maybe the correct command is just "take milk" without specifying "from floor" since the milk is on the floor by default. Or perhaps the game expects a different phrasing. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check if the milk is actually there. But the game's description says it's there. So maybe the correct command is simply "take milk". Let me check the previous steps. The user was told to "lift the milk from the floor of the garden." So the command should be "take milk from floor", but the game isn't recognizing it. Maybe the game uses a different verb, like "pick up" instead of "take"? Or maybe the milk is not considered a visible object. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look around again. But the game's description already states the milk is on the floor. Hmm. Since the user has tried "take milk from floor" multiple times and it's not working, perhaps the correct action is to just "take milk" without the "from floor" part. Let me try that. The game might accept "take milk" as the correct command. So the next action should be "take milk".

Okay, let's see. The user is in a loop between the Kitchen and Bathroom, going back and forth. The original goal was to complete a series of tasks: open the trunk, get the key, unlock the door, make it ajar, then go east, check the screen door, etc. But now they've been moving between rooms without progressing towards the final steps.

The user has already completed the initial tasks in the bedroom. They took the milk from the garden, but there's a mention of a note on the kitchen island. Maybe the note is part of the puzzle? Also, the user is stuck in a cycle between kitchen and bathroom. They need to find a way to proceed. Since the original plan was to go east from the garden, but they ended up in the backyard and then the kitchen again. Maybe they need to check the kitchen island for the note, which might be necessary for the next step. Alternatively, perhaps the milk was supposed to be placed on the stove, but the user hasn't done that yet. Wait, the original instructions said to rest the milk on the stove after stealing it. The user took the milk, but didn't put it on the stove. So maybe that's the next step. But the user is currently in the kitchen. So the correct action would be to go to the stove and put the milk there. But the user is in the kitchen, so they need to go to the stove. However, the stove is described as having nothing on it. So the user needs to put the milk on the stove. The command would be "put milk on stove". But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to do that. But the user is in the kitchen, so they can go to the stove. Alternatively, maybe the note on the kitchen island is important. But the user hasn't checked it. However, the original task didn't mention the note, so maybe it's a red herring. The main thing is to complete the steps: rest the milk on the stove. So the next action is to put the milk on the stove.
