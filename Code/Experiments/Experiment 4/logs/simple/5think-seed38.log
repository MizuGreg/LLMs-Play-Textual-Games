Welcome to TextWorld! First off, ensure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. After pulling open the antique trunk, recover the old key from the antique trunk within the bedroom. Then, insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. And then, ensure that the wooden door is open. And then, make an effort to head east. After that, doublecheck that the screen door is wide open. After that, go to the east. And then, make an attempt to take a trip south. Following that, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. If you have picked up the milk, venture north. And then, go west. And then, sit the milk on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. The room is well lit.

You can make out a chest drawer. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an antique trunk. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been following the instructions step by step. The current situation is that they tried to go east but the wooden door wasn't open yet. The game's feedback says they need to open the door first.

So, the user's last action was "go east", but the system responded that the door needs to be opened. The user is now asking if they're on the right track and what their next move should be. 

Looking back at the steps provided in the initial instructions, after unlocking the wooden door, the next step was to "ensure that the wooden door is open". So, even though they unlocked it, maybe they need to check if it's actually open. But in the game's context, unlocking usually means opening it. However, perhaps there's a step where they have to explicitly open it after unlocking. Or maybe the game requires them to confirm the door is open before proceeding.

The user's score was at 3/5, so they have a few more steps to go. The next steps after opening the door would be to check the screen door, go east, then try to go south, pick up the milk, etc. But the immediate next action here is to make sure the door is open. Since they just unlocked it, maybe they need to "open" it again, but that might be redundant. Alternatively, maybe the game requires them to move through the door. But the system's message says they can't go east until the door is open. So the correct next step is to open the door.

Wait, the user already unlocked the door with the key. Maybe the game considers unlocking and opening as separate steps. So perhaps they need to "open the wooden door" again. But the user's last action was "unlock wooden door", which increased the score. Now, the system says they need to open the door first. So maybe the next step is to "open wooden door" again. But the user might have already done that. Alternatively, maybe the game requires them to "push" or "open" the door after unlocking. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go through the door. But the game's message says they can't go east until the door is open. So the next action should be to open the door. But they already unlocked it. Hmm. Maybe the game's system is confused, but according to the feedback, the user needs to open the door first. So the correct next action is to "open wooden door" again. But the user might have already done that. Wait, the user's last action was "unlock wooden door", which was successful. The system's message says "You have to open the wooden door first." So maybe the user needs to explicitly open it. But how? Maybe the correct command is "open wooden door" again. But the user might not have done that yet. So the next step is to open the door. Therefore, the correct command is "open wooden door".

Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what the user is asking here. They provided a series of interactions in a text-based game, and now they're asking if the actions so far are correct and if they're close to the goal. Then they want the next action.

First, I need to recall the original goal from the initial instructions. The user had to open the antique trunk, get the key, unlock the door, go east, check the screen door, go east again, try to go south, pick up milk, go north, west, and put the milk on the stove. 

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Living Room, and the score is 5/10. The previous actions involved moving between rooms: from Bedroom to Kitchen, then Living Room, back to Kitchen, and Living Room again. The user has yet to pick up the milk from the garden, which was part of the original plan. 

Wait, in the initial instructions, after going east and trying to go south, they needed to lift the milk from the garden. But in the current state, the user is in the Living Room. The garden wasn't mentioned in the current rooms. Maybe the garden is another room that hasn't been explored yet. 

The user's current position is the Living Room. The next step according to the original plan was to go south after picking up the milk. But the user hasn't picked up the milk yet. However, in the current rooms, there's no mention of a garden or milk. The Kitchen and Living Room don't have the milk. So maybe the milk is in a different room that hasn't been accessed yet. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go north from the Living Room, which leads back to the Kitchen. But the original plan had after going south, go north, then west. But the user is stuck in a loop between Kitchen and Living Room. 

Wait, the original steps after unlocking the door and going east (to the Kitchen) were to check the screen door, go east again, then try to go south. But in the current state, the user is in the Living Room, which might be a different room. Maybe the screen door in the Kitchen (east) leads to another room, perhaps the garden where the milk is. 

But in the current scenario, the user is in the Living Room, and the next action would be to go north, which leads back to the Kitchen. But the user hasn't found the milk yet. So perhaps the milk is in the Kitchen or another room. However, in the Kitchen description, there's a note but no milk. The Living Room has a lettuce and a remote, but no milk. 

Wait, maybe the user is supposed to go south from the Kitchen to the garden. But in the current state, the user is in the Living Room. The original plan said after going east (to Kitchen), check the screen door (east), go east again, then try to go south. But in the current state, the user is in the Living Room, which might be a different path. 

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find the milk in the garden, which is a separate room. But the user hasn't explored that yet. The original plan had after going south, pick up the milk, then go north, west, and put it on the stove. 

But in the current state, the user is in the Living Room, and the next step would be to go north back to the Kitchen. However, the user hasn't found the milk. So maybe the milk is in the garden, which is accessible via the screen door in the Kitchen. 

So the user needs to go from the Kitchen east to the screen door, open it, then go into the garden where the milk is. Then pick it up, go north, west, and put it on the stove. 

But in the current state, the user is in the Living Room. The previous action was going south from the Kitchen to the Living Room. So the next step would be to go north back to the Kitchen, then east to the screen door, open it, enter the garden, pick up the milk, then proceed as per the original plan. 

Therefore, the next action should be to go north from the Living Room back to the Kitchen. Then proceed to open the screen door and go east to the garden. But according to the user's last action, they were in the Living Room and the next step would be to go north. 

So the answer should be "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Garden room. The original goal mentioned earlier was to lift the milk from the floor of the garden. The user has already picked up the milk, as per the instructions. The next step after picking up the milk was to venture north, then go west, and then sit the milk on the stove.

Wait, the current room is the Garden. The user has to pick up the milk first. The prompt says "If you have picked up the milk, venture north." So the user needs to check if they have the milk. The current description of the Garden mentions a half of a bag of chips, a milk, a bell pepper, and a shovel on the floor. So the milk is there. The user needs to pick it up.

But in the previous steps, the user was told to "lift the milk from the floor of the garden. If you have picked up the milk, venture north." So the user needs to take the milk first. The next action should be to take the milk. Then, after picking it up, go north. Then go west, and then put the milk on the stove.

But the user's last action was going south to the Garden. Now, in the Garden, the user needs to pick up the milk. So the next command should be "take milk" or "pick up milk". Then, after that, go north. So the correct next action is to take the milk.

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You have walked into the most ordinary of all possible kitchens. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You see a refrigerator. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a counter. The counter appears to be empty. Look over there! a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Classic TextWorld.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in a text adventure game, and they've been following a set of instructions to complete certain tasks. The original goal was to eventually reach the original goal, which isn't explicitly stated, but based on the steps given, it might involve collecting items and navigating through different rooms.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Kitchen again. The previous steps included opening doors, collecting the milk in the garden, and moving between rooms. The current score is 9/20, so there are still several steps left.

The user's last action was going north from the Living Room back to the Kitchen. Now, they need to continue following the original plan. The next step mentioned in the initial instructions was to "sit the milk on the stove." But in the current scenario, the user has the milk in their inventory (they took it from the garden earlier). However, they are in the Kitchen, which has a stove mentioned. So the next logical step would be to place the milk on the stove.

But wait, the user hasn't mentioned putting the milk on the stove yet. The original instructions said: "lift the milk from the floor of the garden. If you have picked up the milk, venture north. And then, go west. And then, sit the milk on the stove." So after picking up the milk, they went north (to the kitchen), then west (back to the backyard?), but in the current state, they're in the Kitchen again. Maybe they need to go west from the Kitchen to the backyard again, then go north to the garden to put the milk on the stove? Wait, no. The stove is in the Kitchen. So perhaps the user is in the Kitchen, has the milk, and needs to put it on the stove.

But in the current room (Kitchen), the stove is mentioned as being empty. So the user needs to put the milk on the stove. The command would be "put milk on stove." However, the user's previous actions have been moving between rooms, so maybe they need to check if the stove is accessible. But according to the description, the stove is in the Kitchen, so the user should be able to interact with it.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go to the garden again, but the original plan said after picking up the milk, go north (to kitchen), then west (to backyard), then sit the milk on the stove. Wait, the original instructions said: "After that, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. If you have picked up the milk, venture north. And then, go west. And then, sit the milk on the stove." So after lifting the milk, go north (to kitchen?), then west (to backyard?), then put it on the stove. But the stove is in the kitchen, not the backyard. So maybe there's a confusion here.

Alternatively, maybe the user is in the Kitchen, has the milk, and needs to put it on the stove. So the correct action is to "put milk on stove." But the user's last action was going north to the Kitchen, so they are in the Kitchen now. The stove is in the Kitchen, so the next step is to put the milk on the stove. Therefore, the correct command is "put milk on stove."
