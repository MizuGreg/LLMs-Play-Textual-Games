Then, try to move south. After that, retrieve the lettuce from the couch. And then, try to head north. Then, place the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. An ordinary one.

You can see a closed chest drawer in the corner. You see an antique trunk. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a king-size bed. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game. They started by opening the antique trunk, taking the old key, unlocking the wooden door, and now they're at the door. The next step according to the original instructions was to "look and see that the wooden door is ajar." But since the door was already unlocked, maybe the next action is to check if it's open. However, the user might need to "look" at the door to confirm it's ajar. But the game's response after unlocking the door might have already indicated that it's open. Wait, the user's last action was unlocking the door, and the score increased. Now, the next step in the original plan was to "try to go east." But the user needs to check if the door is ajar first. However, the game's current state might have the door open after unlocking. So the next action should be to go east. But the user needs to make sure the door is open. Alternatively, maybe the door is now open, so they can proceed. The user's next action should be to go east. Let me check the original instructions again. After unlocking the door, the next step was to "look and see that the wooden door is ajar." So maybe the user needs to look at the door to confirm. But in the game, after unlocking, the door might be open. So the next action would be to go east. But the user's last action was unlocking the door, and the next step is to go east. So the correct command is "go east."

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the game because they tried to go east but the wooden door is still closed. They already have the old key and unlocked the door, but maybe they didn't open it yet? Wait, the previous steps were: open the trunk, take the key, unlock the door. Then they tried to go east, but the game says they have to open the door first. Oh, maybe "unlock" is different from "open". So even though they unlocked it, the door might still be locked but not open. So the next step is to open the door with the key. Let me check the previous messages.

The user tried to go east, but the game said they need to open the door first. So the door is locked but unlocked? Wait, maybe the action is to open the door, not just unlock. So after unlocking, they need to open it. So the correct action here is to open the door. Let me make sure. The user has the key, unlocked the door, but maybe the door is still closed. So the next step is to open the door. So the command should be "open the wooden door".

You are in a kitchen. An usual kind of place. You can barely contain your excitement.

You see a refrigerator. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is standard. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a stove. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you can see a note. Wow! Just like in the movies!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen now. The original goal was to retrieve the lettuce from the couch, place it on the stove in the kitchen, and then win. Wait, but the user just arrived in the kitchen after opening the door east from the bedroom. The current location is the kitchen.

Looking at the kitchen description: there's a refrigerator, a counter, a stove, a kitchen island with a note. The user needs to retrieve the lettuce from the couch. Wait, the couch is in the bedroom, right? Or maybe the couch is in the kitchen? Wait, the original instructions said "retrieve the lettuce from the couch." But in the bedroom description, there's a king-size bed, but no couch. Then, maybe the couch is in the kitchen? Or maybe the user has to go back to the bedroom? Wait, the user just came from the bedroom east into the kitchen. The kitchen has a kitchen island, but where is the couch?

Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. The original instructions said after unlocking the door and going east, then move south, retrieve the lettuce from the couch. But in the current setup, the user is in the kitchen. Maybe the couch is in the kitchen? Or perhaps the user needs to go back to the bedroom? Wait, the kitchen has an open wooden door leading west back to the bedroom. So maybe the couch is in the bedroom? But the bedroom description didn't mention a couch. Hmm.

Wait, the original steps were: after getting the key, unlock the door, go east (which led to the kitchen), then try to move south. Wait, but in the kitchen, the user can go north, south, east, west. The user is in the kitchen now. The next step according to the original plan was after going east (to kitchen), then try to move south. But the user is in the kitchen, so moving south would take them back to the bedroom? Because the kitchen has a west door leading back to the bedroom. So moving south from the kitchen might not be possible. Wait, the kitchen's description says there's a closed screen door east, open wooden door west, and unguarded north and unblocked south. So moving south from the kitchen would take them to another area. But the original plan said after going east (to kitchen), try to move south. But the user is in the kitchen now. So maybe the next step is to move south from the kitchen. But the user's current location is the kitchen. So the next action would be to go south. But the user's previous action was going east from the bedroom to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the user needs to retrieve the lettuce from the couch. But where is the couch? Maybe the couch is in the kitchen? The kitchen description mentions a kitchen island, but not a couch. Maybe the user has to go back to the bedroom? But the original plan said after going east (to kitchen), try to move south. But the user is in the kitchen now. So perhaps the next step is to go south from the kitchen. But the user's current location is the kitchen, so the next action is to go south. However, the user's score is 5/9, and the original goal requires retrieving the lettuce from the couch. Maybe the couch is in the kitchen, but the description doesn't mention it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the bedroom, but the original plan said after going east (to kitchen), then move south. Wait, maybe the user is confused. The original steps were: after getting the key, unlock the door, go east (to kitchen), then move south. But in the kitchen, moving south might not be possible. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the kitchen. The kitchen has an unguarded north entrance. So perhaps the user should go north. But the original plan said after going east, try to move south. But the user is in the kitchen now. So maybe the next step is to go south. But the user's current location is the kitchen. So the next action is to go south. However, the user's score is 5/9, and the original goal requires retrieving the lettuce from the couch. Maybe the user needs to go back to the bedroom, but the original plan said after going east (to kitchen), then move south. But the user is in the kitchen, so moving south would take them to another area. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go north from the kitchen. But the original plan didn't mention that. This is confusing. The user's current location is the kitchen. The next step according to the original plan was after going east (to kitchen), then try to move south. But the user is in the kitchen now. So the next action is to move south. However, the user's previous attempt to go east led to the kitchen, and now they are in the kitchen. The user's next action should be to move south. But the kitchen's description says that moving south is unblocked. So the user should go south. But the user's score is 5/9, and the original goal requires retrieving the lettuce from the couch. Maybe the couch is in the kitchen, but the description doesn't mention it. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go back to the bedroom. But the original plan said after going east (to kitchen), then move south. So perhaps the user should go south from the kitchen. But the user is in the kitchen, so the next action is to go south. However, the user's current location is the kitchen, so the next action is to go south. The user's next action should be to go south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the text game. They started in the bedroom, opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked the door, and then went east into the kitchen. Then they went south to the living room, took the lettuce from the couch. Now, according to the original instructions, after taking the lettuce, they need to place it on the stove inside the kitchen.

Wait, the current location is the living room. The stove is in the kitchen, which is to the west. So the next step would be to go back west to the kitchen, then place the lettuce on the stove. But the user's last action was taking the lettuce from the couch in the living room. The next action should be to go west to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, place the lettuce on the stove. But the user hasn't moved west yet. The previous command was "take the lettuce from the couch", which was successful. Now, the next step is to go west to the kitchen. So the correct command here is "go west".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game, and they've been following the steps to unlock the door, collect the lettuce, and then place it on the stove. So far, they've taken the lettuce from the couch in the living room and are now in the kitchen again.

The next step according to the original plan was to place the lettuce on the stove inside the kitchen. The user is in the kitchen, so the next logical action would be to go to the stove and put the lettuce there. But the current prompt says that the stove is empty, so maybe the user needs to go north to reach the stove. Wait, in the previous steps, when they were in the kitchen, the stove was mentioned as being empty. The user has the lettuce, so they need to go to the stove.

Looking at the current location, the kitchen has a closed screen door east, an open wooden door west, and the option to go north. The user tried going west but couldn't, then went north again. Now, in the kitchen, the stove is in the kitchen, so maybe they need to go to the stove directly. But the user has the lettuce, so the action would be to place it on the stove. However, the game might require moving to the stove first. So the correct command would be to go to the stove, but since the user is already in the kitchen, maybe the stove is in the same room. Alternatively, the user might need to go north to reach the stove. Wait, in the kitchen description, the stove is mentioned as being empty. So the user is in the kitchen, has the lettuce, and needs to place it on the stove. The next action should be to go to the stove and then put the lettuce there. But the user's previous action was going north, which brought them back to the kitchen. So the next step is to go to the stove. But the game might require the user to move to the stove's location. However, in the current kitchen description, the stove is already present. So the user can just place the lettuce on the stove. But the game might require the user to go to the stove first. Alternatively, maybe the stove is in the kitchen, so the user can directly place the lettuce there. The correct command would be to place the lettuce on the stove. But the user has to be at the stove's location. Since the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is in the kitchen, the next action is to go to the stove. But the user might already be there. Alternatively, the user can just place the lettuce on the stove. However, the game might require moving to the stove first. So the next action is to go to the stove. But the user is already in the kitchen. Wait, the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is in the kitchen. So the next action is to place the lettuce on the stove.
