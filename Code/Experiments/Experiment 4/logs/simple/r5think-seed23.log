You are now playing a profound session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, ensure that the antique trunk is open. And then, recover the old key from the antique trunk in the bedroom. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. Then, open the wooden door. And then, move east. And then, make absolutely sure that the screen door is open. Having opened the screen door, attempt to head east. With that done, move south. Then, retrieve the apple from the floor of the garden. And then, make an attempt to venture north. If you can succeed at that, head west. With that accomplished, sit the apple on the stove inside the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in a bedroom.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a chest drawer, so there's that. You make out a closed antique trunk in the corner. You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. They've followed the steps given in the initial instructions. Let me check the current state.

First, they opened the antique trunk and found an old key. Then they took the key, unlocked the wooden door, and the score increased each time. Now, the next step according to the original plan was to open the wooden door. Wait, but the user just unlocked it, so maybe the next step is to open it. But the instruction said "check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key" and then "open the wooden door". So after unlocking, they need to open it. The user has already unlocked it, so now they should open it. Then move east, check the screen door, etc.

But the user's last action was unlocking the door, and the system message says they're at -3/4. The next step would be to open the door. So the correct command here is "open wooden door". The user might have confused "unlock" with "open", but since they've already unlocked it, opening it makes sense. Let me make sure that's the next step. Yes, the original plan says after unlocking, open the door. So the next action should be "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. They've followed the steps given in the initial instructions. Let me recap the steps to make sure I understand where they are.

First, they needed to open the antique trunk in the bedroom, which they did. Then recover the old key from the trunk, which they took. Next, they had to unlock the wooden door with the key, which they did. Then open the door, which they did. Then move east. But when they tried to move east, the game said they needed to name something more substantial. Hmm, maybe "move east" isn't the right command here. Wait, the game might be expecting a different verb or phrase. Let me check the previous interactions.

Looking back, after opening the wooden door, the user was in the bedroom, and the next step was to move east. But the game responded with "You must name something more substantial." So maybe "move east" isn't the correct command. Perhaps they need to use a different verb like "go east" or "head east"? Or maybe there's an object they need to interact with first. Wait, the original instructions said after opening the wooden door, they should move east, then check the screen door. But maybe the game is expecting a different action here.

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to check the screen door first. But the user's last action was moving east, which was rejected. So perhaps the correct command is "go east" instead of "move east"? Let me think. In many text adventures, "go" is the standard verb. So maybe the user should use "go east" instead of "move east". That might be the issue. The game's response was indicating that "move east" wasn't a recognized verb, so the correct command would be "go east". Let me confirm that. The user's previous action was "move east", which was invalid. So the next step should be "go east" to proceed. That makes sense. So the next action should be "go east".

-= Kitchen =-
You've just shown up in a kitchen.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a refrigerator. You make out a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You make out a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user is in the Kitchen, and the goal is to eventually reach the garden and get the apple, then sit it on the stove in the kitchen. So far, they've opened the wooden door east from the bedroom, which led to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, there's a screen door east, a wooden door west (which leads back to the bedroom), and exits to north and south.

The next steps according to the original plan were: after opening the screen door, attempt to head east, then move south. But the user is in the kitchen now. Let me check the current state.

The user's last action was moving east from the bedroom, which led to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, they need to open the screen door (since the screen door is closed). The original instruction said to "make absolutely sure that the screen door is open" before heading east. So the next step should be to open the screen door.

Wait, the kitchen's description says there's a closed screen door leading east. So the user needs to open that. Then, after opening it, they can go east. Then move south. But the user's next action should be to open the screen door. Let me confirm the commands. The user is in the kitchen, and the screen door is closed. So the correct command is "open screen door".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. They've been following the steps given in the initial instructions. Let me recap the current state to make sure I understand where they are.

Starting from the bedroom, they opened the antique trunk, took the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then moved east to the kitchen. Now they're in the kitchen, opened the screen door. The next step according to the original plan was to move east after opening the screen door. But the user just opened the screen door, so the next action should be to go east. However, the game's response after opening the screen door might have some constraints. Let me check the previous steps again.

In the kitchen, there's a closed screen door leading east. After opening it, the user is now in the kitchen. The next step in the original plan was to "move east" after opening the screen door. But the user's last action was "open screen door", and the next command should be "go east" or "move east". However, the system might have a specific command format. The user's previous actions used "go east" and "move east" interchangeably. The assistant's previous response was "go east" after opening the screen door. But the user's last input was "open screen door", and the system's response was "You open screen door." Then the user is asked to proceed. The original plan says after opening the screen door, attempt to head east. So the next action should be "go east" or "move east". The user's previous action was "go east" when in the bedroom, so maybe "go east" is the correct command here. But the system might have specific verbs. Let me check the game's possible commands. The user has used "open", "take", "unlock", "move", "go", etc. The correct command here would be "go east" or "move east". Since the user previously used "go east", it's likely that's the expected command here. So the next action should be "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started by opening the antique trunk, taking the old key, unlocking and opening the wooden door, then moving east. Now they're in the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, and now are in the garden.

The next step according to the original plan was to retrieve the apple from the floor of the garden. The user is in the garden, and the prompt mentions that there's an apple on the floor. So the next action should be to pick up the apple. The user needs to use the command "take apple from floor" or something similar. But in the previous steps, when they took the old key, they used "take old key from antique trunk". So following that pattern, the correct command here would be "take apple from floor". 

Wait, but the user's last action was "go south", which led them to the garden. Now, in the garden, the apple is on the floor. So the next step is to take the apple. The user's next input should be "take apple from floor". Then, after that, they need to venture north, but first, they have to make sure the screen door is open, but they already opened it earlier. Wait, no, the original steps said after opening the screen door and moving east, then move south. Then retrieve the apple, then attempt to venture north. So once the apple is taken, they need to go north. But in the current state, they are in the garden. So after taking the apple, they need to go north. But the user's next action is to take the apple. So the correct command here is "take apple from floor".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps given in the original prompt. They've opened the antique trunk, taken the key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, moved east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, and then moved south to the garden. Now, in the garden, they need to retrieve the apple from the floor.

But the user has tried "take apple from floor" three times, and each time it's been rejected because they can't see the apple. Wait, the game description says: "There is a lettuce, a tomato plant, an apple and a shovel on the floor." So the apple is indeed there. Maybe the issue is with the command syntax. The correct command should be "take apple" without specifying "from floor" since the apple is on the floor by default. Or maybe "take apple from floor" is correct, but the game is not recognizing it. Alternatively, perhaps the apple is not visible, so the user needs to look for it first. But the game's description says the apple is on the floor, so the user should be able to take it. Maybe the correct command is just "take apple". Let me check the previous steps. The user was told that in the garden, the apple is on the floor. So the next step should be to take the apple. The error messages are saying "You can't see any such thing," which suggests that the game doesn't recognize the apple as being there. But according to the game's description, it is there. Maybe the command should be "get apple" instead of "take apple"? Or maybe the user needs to pick it up directly. Alternatively, maybe the game expects the user to use "take apple from floor" even though the apple is on the floor. But the user has tried that three times and it's not working. Maybe the game is expecting a different verb. Let me think. In TextWorld, the correct command would be "take apple" if it's on the floor. The "from floor" part might be redundant. So the user should try "take apple" instead of "take apple from floor". That's probably the issue. The game's description says the apple is on the floor, so the correct command is just "take apple".
