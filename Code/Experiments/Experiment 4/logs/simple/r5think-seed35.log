Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to open the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. With the old key, insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. After that, ensure that the wooden door is open. Then, try to go east. After that, open the refrigerator. After that, recover the tomato plant from the refrigerator. If you can get your hands on the tomato plant, sit the tomato plant on the stove in the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An usual kind of place.

A closed chest drawer is in the room. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an antique trunk. Huh, weird. What's that over there? It looks like it's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me see. The user is playing this text-based game called TextWorld. Their goal is to open a chest drawer in the bedroom, get an old key from it, use the key to unlock a wooden door, then go east, open a refrigerator, get a tomato plant, put it on the stove in the kitchen, and then stop.

So far, they've opened the chest drawer and retrieved the old key. The score is now 2 out of 3. The next step according to the original task was to insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. The user tried "insert old key into wooden door's lock" but the system didn't recognize it. Then they tried "take old key from chest drawer" which worked. Now they need to use the key on the door.

Wait, the correct action here would be to use the key on the lock. In text adventures, the usual command is "use key on lock" or "unlock door with key". But the user might need to specify the exact phrasing. Since the previous attempt was "insert old key into wooden door's lock", which was invalid, maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door with old key". Alternatively, "use old key on wooden door".

But looking at the previous interaction, when they tried "insert old key into wooden door's lock", the system said it's not a recognized verb. So maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" after taking the key. Or perhaps "use old key on lock". But the door is described as a wooden door leading east. So maybe the correct action is "unlock wooden door" using the key. Let me check the game's possible commands. Since the user has the key, they need to unlock the door. The correct command would be "unlock wooden door with old key" or "use old key to unlock wooden door". Alternatively, "insert old key into lock" if the lock is part of the door.

But in the previous step, the user tried "insert old key into wooden door's lock" and it was invalid. So maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" without specifying the key, but since the key is in hand, the game should recognize that. Alternatively, the user might need to use the key on the door's lock. So the next action should be "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door's lock".

Wait, the user's next action after retrieving the key is to insert it into the lock. The system might expect "use old key on lock" or "unlock door with old key". But the exact phrasing depends on the game's command set. Since the user previously tried "insert old key into wooden door's lock" and it was invalid, maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" because the key is already in hand. Let me think. The user has the key, so the next step is to unlock the door. The correct command would be "unlock wooden door" or "use old key on wooden door".

But the user's previous attempt was "insert old key into wooden door's lock", which was invalid. So perhaps the correct command is "unlock wooden door". Let me check the game's possible actions. In TextWorld, the standard way to unlock a door is to use the key on the lock. So the correct command would be "use old key on lock" or "unlock wooden door with old key".

Alternatively, the game might require "insert old key into lock" if the lock is part of the door. But since the door is described as "wooden door leading east", maybe the lock is part of the door. So the correct action is "insert old key into lock" or "unlock wooden door".

But the user tried "insert old key into wooden door's lock" and it was invalid. So maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door". Let me proceed with that. The user needs to unlock the door, so the next action is "unlock wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps correctly so far. They opened the chest drawer, retrieved the old key, unlocked the wooden door. Now the next step according to the original task was to ensure the wooden door is open. Since they just unlocked it, maybe they need to check if it's open. But in the game's context, unlocking usually means it's now open. Then the next step was to go east. So after unlocking, the next action should be to go east. The user's last action was unlocking the door, so the next command should be "go east". Let me confirm the original task steps again: after unlocking the door, go east, then open the refrigerator, retrieve the tomato plant, put it on the stove. So yes, after unlocking, go east. The user's last message was asking if they're close, so the next action is "go east".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the steps in the TextWorld game. They started by opening the chest drawer in the bedroom, retrieving the old key, unlocking the wooden door, and then going east. But when they tried to go east, the game said they had to open the wooden door first. They tried unlocking it again, but the message said it was already unlocked.

Wait, maybe there's a confusion here. The user already unlocked the door, but perhaps the door isn't fully open. The game might require them to open it instead of just unlocking. Let me check the previous steps. The user used "unlock wooden door" with the key, which worked, but maybe the door is locked, so they need to open it. Or maybe "unlock" isn't the correct verb here. In some games, you have to "open" the door after unlocking. But the user already unlocked it, so maybe the next step is to open it. Alternatively, maybe the door is in a different state. The user needs to proceed to the next room, which is east, but the door has to be open. Since the user tried to go east before opening it, the game corrected them. Now, after unlocking, they need to open the door. But the user tried unlocking again and got a message that it's already unlocked. Maybe the correct action is to "open wooden door" instead of "unlock". But the user has the key, so perhaps "unlock" was correct. Hmm. The user's next action should be to go east again after ensuring the door is open. But the game says they have to open the door first. So maybe the user needs to open the door, then go east. But the user already unlocked it. Maybe the game considers unlocking and opening as separate steps. So the user should try opening the door now. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and they need to unlock it again. But the user already did that. This is a bit confusing. The user's next step should be to go east again, but the game says the door must be open. So perhaps the user needs to open the door after unlocking. So the correct action is to open the door, then go east. But the user tried unlocking again and got a message that it's already unlocked. Maybe the correct action is to "open wooden door" now. Let me check the game's possible commands. The user has the key, so they can unlock the door. But maybe the door is locked, so they need to unlock it again. But the game says it's already unlocked. Maybe the user needs to open the door. So the next action is to open the door. Then go east. So the user should try "open wooden door" now.

You are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a refrigerator. You make out a counter. The counter is standard. The counter appears to be empty. You make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove! oh well. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user is in the Kitchen now. The original goal was to open the chest drawer, get the old key, unlock the door, go east, open the fridge, get the tomato plant, put it on the stove, and then stop.

So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the key, unlocked the door, went east to the kitchen. Now they need to open the refrigerator. The next step in the instructions was to open the refrigerator. The user is in the kitchen, and there's a refrigerator mentioned. So the next action should be to open the refrigerator. The command would be "open refrigerator". Let me check if that's the correct next step. Yes, the user needs to open the fridge to retrieve the tomato plant. So the answer is "open refrigerator".

Okay, let's see. The user has to follow a series of steps to complete the game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, retrieved the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, went east to the kitchen, opened the refrigerator, and took the tomato plant. The next step according to the original task was to sit the tomato plant on the stove in the kitchen.

Looking at the current location, the user is in the kitchen. The stove is mentioned as being in the kitchen, and the tomato plant is now in their inventory. The next logical action would be to place the tomato plant on the stove. The command should be "put tomato plant on stove" or something similar. But I need to check if the game expects a specific phrasing. Since the user previously took the tomato plant from the refrigerator, the correct action here is to put it on the stove. The response should only include the command, no extra text. So the next action is to put the tomato plant on the stove.
