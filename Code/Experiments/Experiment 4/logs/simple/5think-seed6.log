Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! First of all, ensure that the antique trunk is open. And then, recover the old key from the antique trunk. With the old key, unlock the wooden door. And then, ensure that the wooden door is open. Then, make an effort to go to the east. After that, ensure that the screen door inside the kitchen is open. After pulling open the screen door, take a trip east. Next, attempt to venture south. After that, pick up the apple from the floor of the garden. After that, travel north. With that accomplished, go west. And then, sit the apple on the stove within the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A typical one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You can make out a closed chest drawer, which looks usual, in the corner. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an antique trunk. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is standard. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instruction. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and then tried to go east but were told to open the door first. They opened the door, and now the score is at 4/6.

The next step in the original plan was to "ensure that the screen door inside the kitchen is open." But wait, the current location is the bedroom after opening the wooden door. The wooden door was leading east, and after opening it, the user is now in the next room. The original instructions mention going east after unlocking the door, which they did. Now, the next step was to check the kitchen's screen door. But how do they get to the kitchen?

Looking at the current location, after opening the wooden door (which was east), the user is now in the room beyond the door. The original plan says after going east, ensure the screen door inside the kitchen is open. So maybe the next room is the kitchen? Or perhaps there's a screen door in the current room?

Wait, the user's last action was opening the wooden door, which was east. The previous room was the bedroom. Now, after opening the door, they are in the next room. The original instructions mention going east again after opening the screen door. But the user needs to find the screen door in the kitchen. Maybe the current room is the kitchen? Or perhaps the screen door is in the kitchen, which is a different location.

Alternatively, maybe the screen door is in the current room. The user needs to check if the screen door is open. If it's closed, they need to open it. The next step would be to look for the screen door and open it. But how do they know where it is? The initial description of the bedroom mentioned a closed wooden door leading east, but after opening it, the user is in a new room. The original plan says after going east, ensure the screen door inside the kitchen is open. So perhaps the next room is the kitchen, and the screen door is there.

So the next action should be to check the screen door in the kitchen. The user needs to open it if it's closed. The command would be "open screen door" or "open kitchen screen door". But the game's responses might require specific commands. Since the user is in the room beyond the wooden door (which was east), they need to look for the screen door. The original instruction says after going east, ensure the screen door is open. So the next step is to open the screen door in the kitchen. Therefore, the correct command is "open screen door inside kitchen" or similar. But the exact wording depends on the game's possible commands. The user's previous actions were "unlock wooden door", "open wooden door", so maybe the next step is to "open screen door" if it's in the current room. The user needs to check the current room's description for the screen door. Since the original plan says to ensure the screen door inside the kitchen is open, the user should look for it and open it. So the next action is "open screen door".

Okay, let me think through what I need to do next. The user's goal is to pick up the apple from the garden and put it on the stove in the kitchen. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, gotten the key, unlocked the door, gone east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east to the backyard, then south to the garden.

In the garden, the items on the floor are a half-bag of chips, a bell pepper, an apple, and a shovel. The next step is to pick up the apple. The user's last action was going south to the garden, so now they need to take the apple. Once they have the apple, they need to go back to the kitchen and put it on the stove.

So the immediate next action should be to pick up the apple. The command would be "take apple from floor" or something similar. But looking at the previous interactions, the user has been using commands like "take old key from antique trunk", so maybe the correct syntax here is "take apple from floor". Let me check the previous commands again. Yes, when they took the key, they specified the item and the location. So the correct command here is "take apple from floor".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a sequence of actions in this TextWorld game. Their goal is to pick up the apple from the garden and put it on the stove in the kitchen. So far, they've managed to open the antique trunk, get the old key, unlock the door, go east to the kitchen, open the screen door, go east to the backyard, then try to go south to the garden. But when they tried to take the apple from the floor in the garden, it didn't work. Then they went back north to the backyard again.

Hmm, the problem might be that they're not in the garden when they try to take the apple. Let me check the previous steps. The user went from the backyard to the garden by going south, but when they tried to take the apple, it didn't work. Then they went back north to the backyard again. So maybe they're not in the garden anymore? Or maybe the apple isn't visible? Wait, in the garden description, there's a half bag of chips, bell pepper, apple, and shovel on the floor. So the apple is there, but maybe the user isn't in the garden when they try to take it. Let me check the last movement. The user just went north from the backyard, which brings them back to the backyard, not the garden. So they need to go south again to get back to the garden. Then, once in the garden, they can take the apple. After that, they need to go back to the kitchen, put the apple on the stove. So the next step should be to go south again to the garden, then take the apple. But the user tried that and got an error. Wait, maybe the apple is not there anymore? Or maybe the user needs to check the garden again. Alternatively, maybe the user is in the garden but the apple is not visible. But according to the garden description, the apple is there. So the correct action is to take the apple from the floor once in the garden. So the user needs to go south again to the garden, then take the apple. Then go north to the kitchen, then put the apple on the stove. So the next command should be to go south to the garden again, then take the apple.

Okay, the user is stuck in the Garden area, repeatedly trying to take the apple from the floor but getting the "You can't see any such thing" message. Let me check the previous steps.

Earlier, in the Garden, the description says there's a half of a bag of chips, a bell pepper, an apple, and a shovel on the floor. The user tried "take apple from floor" but it didn't work. Maybe the game expects a different command, like just "take apple" without specifying the floor, since the apple is already on the floor. Alternatively, maybe the apple is in a different location than described. Wait, the user has been moving between rooms, so maybe they're not in the Garden anymore. But the last move was "go north" leading back to the Backyard, then "go south" back to the Garden. So the user is indeed in the Garden. 

The problem is that the game's parser might not recognize "take apple from floor" as a valid command. The correct command might be "take apple" alone, as the apple is on the floor. The game's inventory system might automatically pick it up when you take it from the floor. So the user should try "take apple" without the "from floor" part. Let me confirm the previous steps: the user was in the Garden, saw the apple on the floor, tried to take it, but the command didn't work. So the next action should be to simply take the apple.
