Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! First, it would be fantastic if you could ensure that the chest drawer is open. After that, recover the old key from the chest drawer. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. And then, head east. And then, make absolutely sure that the screen door within the kitchen is wide open. After that, make an effort to go to the east. With that accomplished, make an attempt to go south. With that accomplished, lift the milk from the floor of the garden. After that, try to venture north. Then, make an attempt to travel west. With that done, rest the milk on the stove within the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
I am excited to announce that you are now in the bedroom.

You see a closed chest drawer. You can make out an antique trunk. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can make out a king-size bed! But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the king-size bed.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game, and they've been following a set of instructions to complete various tasks. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door in the bedroom, then went east into the kitchen. In the kitchen, they opened the screen door after it was closed.

Now, the user is at the kitchen, having opened the screen door. The next step in their original plan was to "make an effort to go to the east" after opening the screen door. But since the screen door is now open, they can go east. However, the current location is the kitchen, and the screen door leading east is open. So the next logical step would be to go east. But wait, in the previous interaction, after opening the screen door, the user was prompted to go east, but the system said they had to open the screen door first. Now that it's open, they can proceed.

The user's next action should be to go east. The previous response was "go east", but the system said the screen door had to be opened first. Now that it's open, going east is possible. So the correct command here is "go east".

You can see a bbq. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You see a patio table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a patio table? The patio table is standard. However, the patio table, like an empty patio table, has nothing on it.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. They've been moving through different rooms: bedroom, kitchen, backyard, and now the garden. The goal seems to be to complete a series of tasks, like opening drawers, finding keys, unlocking doors, and eventually lifting the milk from the garden.

The user is currently in the garden, where they need to pick up the milk. They tried "lift milk from floor of garden" but the system didn't recognize it. Then they tried "pick up milk from floor of garden" again, but the system still didn't understand. The user is confused and wants to know if they're on the right track.

Looking at the game's structure, the previous steps were successful except for the milk part. The user might be using the correct verb "pick up" but the system is expecting a different phrasing. In text adventures, commands are usually concise. Maybe the correct command is just "pick up milk" without specifying the floor. Alternatively, the game might require "take milk" or "get milk".

The user's next action should be to try a different phrasing. Since the system didn't accept "pick up milk from floor of garden" the second time, maybe just "pick up milk" is sufficient. The game might automatically associate the milk with the floor if it's on the floor. Also, the user needs to move to the next step after picking up the milk, which is to venture north. So after picking up the milk, they should try to go north.

But the user's last action was trying to pick up the milk again. The system's response was still not understanding. So the correct command might be "take milk" or "get milk". Alternatively, the game might require the user to be in the correct location. Since the milk is on the floor of the garden, the user is already there. So the next step is to use the correct verb. Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "lift milk" which was incorrect, then "pick up milk from floor of garden" which was also incorrect. The system might be expecting "pick up milk" without the floor part. So the next command should be "pick up milk".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've been following a series of steps to complete tasks. The original goal was to go through various rooms, open doors, pick up items, and eventually reach the end. 

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Living Room again, having cycled through the Kitchen and Living Room multiple times. The score is at 9/18, which suggests they've completed most of the required steps but might be stuck in a loop. The tasks they needed to do included opening the chest drawer, getting the key, unlocking and opening the wooden door, going east, opening the screen door, and then moving around to the garden, picking up the milk, and finally resting the milk on the stove in the kitchen.

Wait, the last action was going south from the Kitchen back to the Living Room. The user is now in the Living Room again, and the next step would be to go north back to the Kitchen. But the user is being asked if they're close to the goal. Considering the tasks, they might have missed the final step of putting the milk on the stove. However, in the current scenario, they have the milk picked up in the Garden and are now in the Living Room. The stove is in the Kitchen, so they need to go back to the Kitchen and put the milk on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, in the previous steps, after picking up the milk in the Garden, they went north to the Backyard, then west to the Kitchen, then south to the Living Room. Now, they need to go back north to the Kitchen again to put the milk on the stove. But the user might not have realized that the final step is to rest the milk on the stove in the kitchen. So the next action should be to go north to the Kitchen and then put the milk on the stove. However, the user's last action was going south, leading them back to the Living Room. So the next step would be to go north again to the Kitchen, then put the milk on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, in the current prompt, the user is in the Living Room, so the next command should be to go north to the Kitchen to complete the task.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text adventure game, and they've been following a series of steps to complete tasks. The original goal was to go through a series of rooms, open doors, retrieve items, and eventually reach the end.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the Kitchen again, with the same description as before. The score is at 9/27, which suggests that they've completed most of the required steps but might be stuck in a loop. The user has been repeatedly going between the Kitchen and Living Room, which might indicate that they're not progressing towards the final goal.

The original instructions mentioned lifting the milk from the garden, resting it on the stove in the kitchen, and then proceeding. However, the user has already picked up the milk and is now back in the kitchen. The next step should be to rest the milk on the stove. But in the current dialogue, the user hasn't done that yet. 

Wait, in the previous steps, after picking up the milk in the garden, the user went back through the rooms, but didn't place the milk on the stove. The current location is the kitchen, which has a stove mentioned. So the next logical step would be to place the milk on the stove. However, the user's last action was going north again, which just takes them back to the kitchen. 

But the user's last command was "go north" again, which leads them back to the kitchen. The system's response is the same kitchen description. The user might be stuck in a loop between the kitchen and living room. The key action missing is placing the milk on the stove. So the correct next step should be to put the milk on the stove. However, the user hasn't done that yet. 

But in the current state, the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is mentioned. So the next action should be to put the milk on the stove. However, the user's previous actions didn't include that. Therefore, the correct command here is to "put milk on stove" or similar. But the system might require the exact phrasing. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is supposed to go to the garden again to rest the milk. Wait, no, the original instructions said after lifting the milk from the garden, rest it on the stove in the kitchen. So the user has the milk, and now needs to go to the kitchen and put it on the stove. But the user is already in the kitchen. So the next step is to put the milk on the stove. 

But the user hasn't done that yet. So the correct command here is to "put milk on stove" or "rest milk on stove". However, the system might require the exact command. Looking back at the previous interactions, when the user tried to "lift milk", the system corrected it to "pick up milk". So maybe the correct command here is "put milk on stove".
