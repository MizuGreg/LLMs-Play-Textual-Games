Welcome to TextWorld! First of all, you could, like, doublecheck that the chest drawer is opened. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. After that, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. After that, open the wooden door. And then, travel east. Once you manage that, open the refrigerator within the kitchen. Then, recover the bell pepper from the refrigerator. If you have picked up the bell pepper, place the bell pepper on the stove inside the kitchen. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just sauntered into a bedroom.

You make out a closed chest drawer nearby. You make out a closed antique trunk, which looks standard, nearby. You can make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. What's the point of an empty king-size bed?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld. The goal is to follow a series of steps to reach the original goal, which I assume is something like escaping or completing a quest. The user has already opened the chest drawer and retrieved the old key, but there was a mistake in the command.

First, the user tried "retrieve old key from chest drawer," but the system said that's not a recognized verb. So I need to figure out the correct command. In text adventures, common verbs are like 'take', 'get', 'open', 'use', etc. Since the key is in the chest drawer, the correct action would be to take the key. The previous step was opening the chest drawer, which revealed the key. So the next step should be taking the key.

But the user might have confused "retrieve" with "take." So the correct command here is "take old key." Alternatively, maybe "get old key." But in the game's context, the correct verb might be "take." Let me check the previous interaction. The user said "retrieve old key from chest drawer," which the system rejected. So the correct action is probably "take old key" without the "from chest drawer" part, since the key is already in the chest drawer after opening it. So the next action should be taking the key.

Then, after taking the key, the next step is to unlock the wooden door with the old key. So the user needs to use the key on the door. The command would be "unlock wooden door with old key" or "use old key on wooden door." But the game might expect "unlock wooden door" after using the key. Wait, the original instructions said to check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. So maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" using the key. But the exact command depends on the game's syntax.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "use old key on wooden door" to unlock it. But the user's previous action was retrieving the key, so after that, the next step is to unlock the door. So the correct command here is "unlock wooden door" using the key. However, the system might require the player to use the key first. So the next action after taking the key is to unlock the door.

But the user's last action was "retrieve old key from chest drawer," which was invalid. The correct command should be "take old key." Then, after taking the key, the next step is to unlock the door. So the user needs to take the key first. Therefore, the correct next action is "take old key."

Okay, let's see. The user is playing a text adventure game. The goal seems to be to retrieve the bell pepper from the refrigerator in the kitchen, which is part of a sequence of steps.

So far, the player has opened the chest drawer in the bedroom, retrieved the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door. The next step mentioned in the initial instructions was to travel east after opening the door. The user is now at the bedroom with the door open, and the next logical step would be to go east.

The user's last action was opening the wooden door, and the current location is probably the room beyond the door. The next step in the plan is to move east. The assistant should respond with "go east" as the next command. The user has been following the steps correctly, so it's likely the right move. The score is increasing, so the player is on the right track. The answer should just be the command without any extra text.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can make out a refrigerator. You see a counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You scan the room, seeing a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the chest drawer, get the old key, unlock and open the wooden door, then go east to the kitchen. Now they're in the kitchen, and the next step according to the original plan was to open the refrigerator, retrieve the bell pepper, put it on the stove, etc.

The current location is the kitchen. The user needs to open the refrigerator. The previous steps have been successful, so the next logical action is to open the refrigerator. The user's last action was going east, which led them to the kitchen. Now, the prompt mentions the refrigerator is closed, so the next command should be to open it. Let me check the previous messages to confirm. Yes, the user is in the kitchen, and the refrigerator is mentioned as closed. So the correct action here is to open the refrigerator.

Okay, let me figure out the next step here. The user has been following the instructions to open the refrigerator in the kitchen. They found a bell pepper inside. The next step according to the original plan was to retrieve the bell pepper, then place it on the stove.

So, after opening the refrigerator and finding the bell pepper, the next action should be to take the bell pepper. The user has to pick it up. Then, once they have it, they need to go to the stove and put it there. But the current location is the kitchen, and the stove is mentioned as being in the kitchen. So the next command should be to take the bell pepper from the refrigerator. Wait, but the refrigerator is already open, and the bell pepper is inside. So the correct action is to take the bell pepper. Let me check the previous steps again.

Yes, the user just opened the refrigerator and saw the bell pepper. The next step is to take it. So the command should be "take bell pepper" or "take the bell pepper". But in the game's context, maybe it's just "take bell pepper". Let me make sure. The user's previous action was "open refrigerator", which worked. So the next action is to take the bell pepper. Then, after that, go to the stove and put it there. But the user has to do each step one at a time. So the next command is to take the bell pepper.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to solve the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, got the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. Now they're in the kitchen, opened the refrigerator, took the bell pepper. The next step according to the original plan was to place the bell pepper on the stove.

So the current location is the kitchen, and the next action should be to go to the stove. But how? The user is in the kitchen, and the stove is mentioned as being in the kitchen. The previous actions included opening the refrigerator, taking the bell pepper. Now they need to place it on the stove. But the command structure here is that they need to move to the stove's location or directly interact with it.

Looking at the previous commands, after opening the refrigerator, the user took the bell pepper. Now, the next step is to go to the stove. The kitchen has a stove, so the user needs to go to the stove's location. The available commands in the kitchen include the stove, so the next action should be to go to the stove. But the user has to use the correct command. The previous actions were "open refrigerator", "take bell pepper". Now, the next step is to go to the stove, then put the bell pepper on it. But the user's last action was taking the bell pepper, so the next step is to go to the stove. The command would be "go to stove" or "go to stove inside kitchen". But in the game's context, the correct command is "go to stove" or "go to the stove". However, in the previous steps, the user was told to "place the bell pepper on the stove inside the kitchen". So the user needs to go to the stove's location first. Therefore, the next action is "go to stove".
