Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to ensure that the antique trunk is open. After that, recover the old key from the antique trunk within the bedroom. After that, unlock the wooden door. After that, open the wooden door. And then, venture east. Okay, and then, ensure that the refrigerator is open. And then, retrieve the tomato plant from the refrigerator in the kitchen. If you have taken the tomato plant, place the tomato plant on the stove within the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a bedroom.

You can make out a closed chest drawer right there by you. You can see a closed antique trunk nearby. Look over there! a king-size bed. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a king-size bed, go to TextWorld. The king-size bed is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

Oh, great. Here's a refrigerator. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. The counter is normal. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You see a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You make out a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user has already opened the refrigerator and found a tomato plant and milk. The next step according to the original instructions was to retrieve the tomato plant from the refrigerator in the kitchen. So, the next action should be to take the tomato plant.

Wait, the user just opened the refrigerator, so the tomato plant is inside. The command should be "take tomato plant from refrigerator". But in the game, sometimes you just say "take tomato plant" if it's in the open container. Let me check the previous actions. Earlier, when the user took the old key from the trunk, they said "take old key from antique trunk". So maybe here, it's "take tomato plant from refrigerator". But the refrigerator is open, so maybe just "take tomato plant". However, the game might require specifying the container. Let me see the previous interaction. When the user opened the refrigerator, the game responded with the items inside. So the next step is to take the tomato plant. The correct command would be "take tomato plant from refrigerator". But the user might have to just say "take tomato plant" if the game expects that. Alternatively, maybe "take tomato plant" is sufficient. Let me check the previous actions again. The user took the key from the trunk, which was a specific command. So here, since the tomato plant is in the refrigerator, the correct command is "take tomato plant from refrigerator". But the user might have to just say "take tomato plant" if the game allows that. However, the game's previous response when the user opened the refrigerator showed the items, so the next step is to take the tomato plant. The correct command is "take tomato plant from refrigerator". But the user might have to just say "take tomato plant" if the game's parser is lenient. Alternatively, maybe "take tomato plant" is enough. Let me think. The user's previous action was "open refrigerator", and the game showed the items inside. So the next action is to take the tomato plant. The correct command would be "take tomato plant from refrigerator". But the user's previous action when taking the key was "take old key from antique trunk". So following that pattern, here it should be "take tomato plant from refrigerator". However, maybe the game allows just "take tomato plant" since the refrigerator is open. But to be precise, I should follow the previous pattern. So the next action is "take tomato plant from refrigerator".
