Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, doublecheck that the antique trunk in the bedroom is open. Then, pick up the old key from the antique trunk. Then, make it so that the wooden door within the bedroom is unlocked. Then, open the wooden door. After opening the wooden door, venture east. Then, open the screen door. Then, make an attempt to head east. That done, take a trip south. Then, pick up the milk from the floor of the garden. After getting the milk, try to head north. That done, attempt to take a trip west. Then, sit the milk on the stove in the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An usual one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see a chest drawer. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an antique trunk. Were you looking for a king-size bed? Because look over there, it's a king-size bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You make out a closed refrigerator in the corner. You make out a counter. The counter is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. Now why would someone leave that there? On the kitchen island you see a note. You shudder, but continue examining the room.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let me try to figure out what to do next. The user is in the kitchen, and they tried to go east but were told they need to open the screen door first. The current score is 5/7, so they've done most of the steps mentioned.

The original goal was to pick up the milk from the garden, then go north, then west, and put the milk on the stove. But the user is now in the kitchen. Wait, the previous step was venturing east from the bedroom, which led to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, there's a closed screen door leading east. The user needs to open that screen door before going east again.

But the user's next action should be to open the screen door. However, the user might be confused because they were told to open the screen door first. So the correct next step is to open the screen door. Then, after that, they can go east again. But the user's last action was "go east" which didn't work because the screen door was closed. So the next command should be "open screen door".

Wait, the user's last input was "go east" which resulted in the message that the screen door needs to be opened. So the correct next action is to open the screen door. Then, after opening it, they can go east again. So the next command should be "open screen door".

-= Backyard =-
You've just sauntered into a backyard.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a set of chairs. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a bbq. But the thing is empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a patio table. But the thing is empty.

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unguarded.

There is a lettuce, a milk, a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instruction. They started in the bedroom, opened the trunk, got the key, unlocked and opened the door, went east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden. In the garden, they picked up the milk.

Now, the next step according to the original plan was after picking up the milk, try to head north. Then, after that, attempt to take a trip west. Then, sit the milk on the stove in the kitchen. But the user's last action was picking up the milk in the garden. The current location is the garden. The next step should be to go north from the garden. Let me check the previous steps to confirm.

Yes, the original instructions said: After getting the milk, try to head north. That done, attempt to take a trip west. Then, sit the milk on the stove in the kitchen. So after picking up the milk, the next action is to go north. The user is in the garden, and the garden's description says that going north is unguarded. So the correct command here is "go north". Then, once in the kitchen, they would go west, but first, they need to go north from the garden. So the next action is "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in the TextWorld game. Their goal was to perform a sequence of actions starting from the bedroom, opening the trunk, getting the key, unlocking and opening the door, then moving east, opening the screen door, going east again, picking up the milk, and then heading back north to the garden. Now, after going west from the backyard back to the kitchen, the user is at the kitchen again.

The next step in the original plan was to "sit the milk on the stove in the kitchen." The user has the milk in their inventory, as they picked it up in the garden. So the next logical action would be to go to the stove and place the milk there. However, the current location is the kitchen, and the stove is mentioned as being in the kitchen. The user needs to interact with the stove to put the milk on it. 

But the user's last action was "go west," which brought them back to the kitchen. The available actions here are to interact with the stove, perhaps. The command should be "put milk on stove" or something similar. However, in TextWorld, the exact phrasing might matter. The user has to use the correct command to place the milk on the stove. Since the stove is in the kitchen, and the user is here, the next step is to put the milk on the stove. 

So the correct command would be "put milk on stove." That's the next action needed to complete the task. The user has already completed most of the steps, so this should be the final step before finishing the game.
