Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, ensure that the chest drawer is open. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer inside the bedroom. With the old key, doublecheck that the wooden door is unlocked. And then, open the wooden door within the bedroom. Then, attempt to go east. Then, make absolutely sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is opened. And then, attempt to venture east. Next, travel south. And then, lift the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. Then, make an effort to move north. If you can finish that, venture west. And then, rest the half of a bag of chips on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just sauntered into a bedroom. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can see a chest drawer. You can see an antique trunk. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. The king-size bed appears to be empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a refrigerator. Hmmm... what else, what else? You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

You see a set of chairs. The set of chairs appears to be empty. You move on, clearly depressed by your TextWorld experience. You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio table. The patio table is normal. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is in the Backyard and has already completed several steps. They need to lift the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. Wait, the current location is the Backyard, and the task mentions the garden. Maybe the garden is part of the Backyard? The user has to find the half-bag of chips on the floor.

Looking at the Backyard description: the user sees chairs, a BBQ, a patio table. The patio table is normal but empty. The chairs are empty. The user needs to find the chips. Maybe the chips are on the patio table or somewhere else. But the description doesn't mention the chips yet. Wait, the user's previous action was going east from the kitchen, which led to the Backyard. The next step is to lift the half-bag of chips from the garden's floor. So maybe the garden is a different area, but the user is in the Backyard now. Maybe the garden is part of the Backyard, so the user needs to check the floor here.

The user's next action should be to pick up the chips. But the current description doesn't mention the chips. Wait, maybe the user needs to search the area. The user is in the Backyard, and the task says to lift the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden. So perhaps the garden is part of the Backyard, and the user needs to look around. The user might need to check the floor where they are. Since the patio table is empty, maybe the chips are on the ground. The user should pick them up.

So the next command would be to take the half-bag of chips. But the user needs to first find it. However, in the current Backyard description, there's no mention of the chips. Maybe the user needs to look around. But according to the game's structure, the user might have to interact with the environment. Since the user is in the Backyard, and the task is to lift the chips from the garden's floor, perhaps the user needs to check the floor here. The correct action would be to pick up the chips once they are found. But since the description doesn't mention them, maybe the user needs to look for it. However, the game might have the chips already in the scene. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to move to the garden area. But the current location is the Backyard. Maybe the garden is part of the Backyard, so the user can pick it up here.

So the next action is to pick up the half of a bag of chips. The user's next command should be "take half of a bag of chips from floor" or something similar. But the game might have specific commands. The user's previous actions were "open screen door", "go east", which led to the Backyard. Now, the user needs to find the chips. The correct command would be to take the chips from the floor. So the next action is "take half of a bag of chips from floor".

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete the TextWorld game. They've gone through the bedroom, kitchen, backyard, and now the garden. The goal was to take the half of a bag of chips from the floor of the garden and then put it on the stove. 

In the garden, the user found an apple, lettuce, a half of a bag of chips, and a shovel. The previous attempts to take the half of a bag of chips didn't work. The user tried "take half of a bag of chips from floor" but got "You can't see any such thing." Then they tried looking around again, but it didn't help.

Wait, maybe the half of a bag of chips is already on the floor, but the command needs to be more precise. The user might need to use "take half of a bag of chips" without specifying the floor if it's already on the floor. Alternatively, maybe the item is under something else, like the shovel. But earlier, when they looked under the shovel, there was nothing.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to pick up the half of a bag of chips directly. Since the game says "There is an apple, a lettuce, a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor," the half of a bag of chips is on the floor. So the correct command should be "take half of a bag of chips" without specifying the floor. But the user tried that and got an error. Maybe the game is case-sensitive or the item has a different name. Wait, the user tried "take half of a bag of chips from floor" and it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is just "take half of a bag of chips".

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to check if the item is visible. The user tried "look around" and "look under patio table" but didn't find it. But in the garden, the items are on the floor. So perhaps the correct action is to take the half of a bag of chips directly. The user might need to try that again. So the next action should be "take half of a bag of chips".

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to rest the half of a bag of chips on the stove. But the game says that's not a recognized verb. Hmm, maybe the correct command is different. Let me think about the possible actions here.

In TextWorld games, commands are usually verbs that directly interact with objects. The user has the half of a bag of chips in hand. The stove is an object in the Backyard. The action needed is to place the item on the stove. But the previous attempt used "rest", which didn't work. Maybe "put" is the correct verb here. Let me check the previous interactions.

Looking back, the user tried "rest half of a bag of chips on stove" multiple times, but it's not working. The game might expect "put" instead of "rest". So the correct command should be "put half of a bag of chips on stove". Let me confirm that. Yes, "put" is a common verb for placing items. So the next action should be to use "put" instead of "rest".

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to complete the TextWorld game. They've done most of the steps except for the final part where they need to rest the half-bag of chips on the stove. The problem is that the command "rest half of a bag of chips on stove" isn't working. The user has tried multiple variations, like "put half of a bag of chips on stove," but it's not recognized.

First, I need to check if the correct verb is being used. The game's response says "That's not a verb I recognise," so maybe "rest" isn't the right verb here. Maybe the correct verb is "put" or "place." But the user tried "put" and it still didn't work. Wait, maybe the game expects a different phrasing. For example, "put the half of a bag of chips on the stove" instead of "rest."

But the user's previous attempt was "put half of a bag of chips on stove," which the game didn't recognize. Maybe the game requires the object to be specified with "the" or the noun form. Alternatively, maybe the stove is named differently in the game. Let me check the previous scenes.

In the Garden scene, the user saw a stove. The Backyard has a patio table, but the stove is in the Garden. Wait, the user is in the Backyard now. Wait, no, the last move was "go north" from the Backyard to the Garden. Wait, the user is in the Garden now. Wait, the last interaction was in the Garden, where there's a stove. So the user has the half-bag of chips, and needs to put it on the stove.

But the game says "You can't see any such thing" when trying to put it on the stove. Maybe the stove isn't visible? Or maybe the user hasn't interacted with the stove yet. Wait, in the Garden description, it says "There is an apple, a lettuce, a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor." So the stove is mentioned as an exit to the north, but not in the items on the floor. So the stove is a separate object. The user needs to put the chips on the stove, but the stove isn't in the same location as the chips. Wait, the user is in the Garden, and the stove is in the Garden? Or is the stove in the Kitchen?

Wait, the Kitchen has a stove. But the user is in the Garden now. Wait, the user went from Backyard to Garden. The Garden's description says there's an exit to the north (which would be Backyard again?), but the stove is in the Kitchen. Maybe the user needs to go back to the Kitchen to put the chips on the stove. But the original goal was to rest the chips on the stove, which is in the Kitchen. But the user is in the Garden now. So perhaps the user needs to go back to the Kitchen, but the path is unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the stove is in the Garden. The Garden's description says "There is an apple, a lettuce, a half of a bag of chips and a shovel on the floor." But the stove is mentioned as an exit to the north. Maybe the stove is in the Garden, and the user can put the chips on it there. But the game says "You can't see any such thing" when trying to put the chips on the stove. That suggests that the stove isn't in the current location. So maybe the user needs to go to the Kitchen to put the chips on the stove there.

But the user is in the Garden. The Garden's exit to the north is Backyard. The Backyard has a screen door west and exit south. The Kitchen is probably accessible via the Backyard's screen door. So the user needs to go back to the Kitchen, then put the chips on the stove there. But the user hasn't gone back to the Kitchen yet. So the next step would be to go back to the Kitchen, then put the chips on the stove.

But the user is in the Garden, and the previous action was "go north" to the Garden. Wait, the user was in the Backyard, then went north to the Garden. Now, the user is in the Garden. The stove is in the Kitchen, which is probably accessible via the Backyard's screen door. So the user needs to go back to the Backyard, then through the screen door to the Kitchen, then put the chips on the stove.

But the user is in the Garden. The Garden's exit to the north is Backyard. So the user should go north to Backyard, then west through the screen door to the Kitchen, then put the chips on the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to go back to the Backyard, then to the Kitchen, then put the chips on the stove.

But the user is in the Garden, and the current location is Garden. The user needs to go back to Backyard, then to Kitchen. So the next command should be "go north" to Backyard, then "go west" through the screen door to Kitchen, then "put half of a bag of chips on stove".

But the user is in the Garden, and the last action was "go north" to Garden. Wait, no, the user was in the Backyard, then "go north" to Garden. Now, the user is in the Garden. The Garden's exit to the north is Backyard, so to go back, the user should "go north" again to Backyard. Then, from Backyard, go west through the screen door to Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, put the chips on the stove.

But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next step is to go back to Backyard, then to Kitchen, then put the chips on the stove. However, the user is in the Garden, and the current location is Garden. The user needs to go back to Backyard first. So the next command should be "go north" to Backyard. Then, from Backyard, "go west" to Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, "put half of a bag of chips on stove".

But the user is in the Garden, and the current location is Garden. The user hasn't gone back to Backyard yet. So the next step is to go north to Backyard. Then, from Backyard, go west to Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, put the chips on the stove.

But the user is in the Garden, and the last action was "go north" to Garden. So the next command is "go north" again to Backyard. Then, "go west" to Kitchen. Then, "put half of a bag of chips on stove".

But the user is in the Garden, and the current location is Garden. The user needs to go back to Backyard. So the next command is "go north" to Backyard. Then, from Backyard, "go west" to Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, "put half of a bag of chips on stove".

But the user is in the Garden, and the current location is Garden. The user hasn't gone back to Backyard yet. So the next step is to go north to Backyard. Then, from Backyard, go west to Kitchen. Then, in the Kitchen, put the chips on the stove.

Therefore, the correct next action is to go back to Backyard, then to Kitchen, then put the chips on the stove. But the user is in the Garden, so the next command is "go north" to Backyard.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

There is an apple, a lettuce and a shovel on the floor.

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see a set of chairs. The set of chairs appears to be empty. You move on, clearly depressed by your TextWorld experience. You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio table. The patio table is normal. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

You arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a refrigerator. Hmmm... what else, what else? You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is ordinary. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in this TextWorld game. They've been moving around different rooms, collecting items, but they're having trouble placing the half-bag of chips on the stove. The problem is that the game's response says "You can't see any such thing" when they try to put it there. 

First, I need to recall the previous steps. The user took the half-bag of chips from the garden floor. Then, they tried to rest it on the stove in the backyard, but it didn't work. Now, they're in the kitchen again, and maybe they need to find the stove here. Wait, in the kitchen description, there's a stove mentioned. But the user hasn't interacted with it yet.

Wait, the original goal was to rest the half-bag of chips on the stove. The user has the item, but they might not be in the right place. The stove in the kitchen might be the correct one. But in the kitchen, the stove is described as ordinary and empty. So maybe the user needs to go to the kitchen's stove and place the chips there.

But in the current state, the user is in the kitchen again, after moving between rooms. The previous attempt was in the backyard, but the stove there wasn't visible. So perhaps the correct action is to go to the kitchen's stove and put the chips there. However, the user hasn't tried that yet.

Alternatively, maybe the stove in the kitchen is the correct one. The user has the chips, so they need to go to the kitchen's stove and put them on it. The command would be "put half of a bag of chips on stove" but in the kitchen. However, the game might not recognize the command if the stove isn't explicitly named. Wait, in the kitchen description, the stove is mentioned as "the stove is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it." So maybe the user needs to go to the stove and place the chips there.

But the user is currently in the kitchen, so maybe they can just try putting the chips on the stove here. However, the previous attempts in the backyard failed. Maybe the correct location is the kitchen's stove. So the next step is to try putting the chips on the stove in the kitchen. The command would be "put half of a bag of chips on stove". But the game might not recognize that if the stove isn't named. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go to the stove first.

Wait, in the kitchen, the user can see the stove. So the correct action is to go to the stove and then put the chips there. But the user is already in the kitchen. So the next step is to try putting the chips on the stove here. The previous failure might be because the user tried to put it in the backyard's stove, which wasn't there. Now, in the kitchen, the stove is present. So the correct command is "put half of a bag of chips on stove".
