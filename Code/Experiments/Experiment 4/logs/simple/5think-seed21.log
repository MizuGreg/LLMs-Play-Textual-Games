You are now playing a profound game of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to open the antique trunk in the bedroom. After that, pick up the old key from the antique trunk. After picking up the old key, assure that the wooden door is unlocked. And then, open the wooden door inside the bedroom. And then, attempt to go east. Following that, go to the south. Then, recover the apple from the couch in the living room. After that, try to venture north. After that, put the apple on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in a bedroom.

You see a closed chest drawer. You see a closed antique trunk in the room. You can see a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can make out a refrigerator. You see a counter. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove! The stove is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a kitchen island. You shudder, but continue examining the kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can make out a note. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this!

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unguarded exit to the north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.
