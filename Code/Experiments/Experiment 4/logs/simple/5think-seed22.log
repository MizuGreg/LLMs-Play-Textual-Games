Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to open the chest drawer within the bedroom. After that, recover the old key from the chest drawer. Then, unlock the wooden door within the bedroom. And then, assure that the wooden door is ajar. After opening the wooden door, attempt to move east. Then, make sure that the screen door inside the kitchen is ajar. After pulling open the screen door, take a trip east. Following that, make an effort to venture south. With that accomplished, pick up the milk from the floor of the garden. Then, head north. Next, try to go west. With that accomplished, rest the milk on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A standard one.

Were you looking for a chest drawer? Because look over there, it's a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. Look over there! a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let me try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to win. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, but tried to push it open and failed. Now, they're at a point where they need to make sure the door is ajar.

Wait, the previous step was trying to push the wooden door open, but the game said they can't see any such thing. Then they tried to unlock the door again, but it's already unlocked. The next step according to the original instructions was to assure the wooden door is ajar. Since the door is already unlocked, maybe they need to open it manually. But the user tried to push it and it didn't work. Maybe the correct action is to open the door instead of pushing? Or perhaps there's another step needed.

Looking back at the original instructions: after unlocking the door, they need to "assure that the wooden door is ajar." So maybe the door is unlocked but not open. The user tried to push it, which might not be the right action. The correct action might be to open the door. But in text adventures, sometimes "open" is the command. Alternatively, maybe "push" is the right verb here. But the game said "You can't see any such thing" when they tried to push. That might mean that pushing isn't the right action. Maybe they need to use the key again? But the door is already unlocked. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the door is locked but they've already unlocked it. Wait, the user had to unlock the door with the key, and then the door is unlocked. Now, they need to open it. So the next step is to open the door. The game might expect the command "open wooden door" instead of pushing. Let me check the previous steps. The user tried "push wooden door open" and it failed. So maybe the correct action is "open wooden door". Let me try that.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the game. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, pushed it open, then went east to the kitchen. Then they had to open the screen door, which they did, and then went east again to the backyard.

Now, the current location is the backyard. The next step according to the original plan was to venture south from the backyard. The user's last action was moving east to the backyard, and now they need to go south. The backyard has an unblocked exit to the south, so that should be possible. The next step is to go south, then pick up the milk from the garden, head north, go west, rest the milk on the stove, and then win. So the next command should be 'go south'.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in this text-based game. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, moved east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, and now they're in the garden. The goal is to pick up the milk from the floor here.

The user has tried "take milk from floor" a few times, but the system keeps saying it only understood them as far as wanting to pick up the milk. Maybe the correct command is different. Let me check the game's context again. In the garden description, it says there's a milk on the floor. The previous attempts were "take milk from floor" and "pick up milk from floor". The system responded that it only understood the latter part. Maybe the correct verb is "take" instead of "pick up"? Or perhaps the command should be more direct, like "take milk" without specifying the location. Alternatively, maybe the game expects the player to use "get" instead of "take" or "pick up".

Wait, in the garden description, the milk is on the floor. So the correct action would be to take the milk from the floor. But the user has tried "take milk from floor" and "pick up milk from floor", both of which the system didn't accept. The system's response was that it only understood the latter part. Maybe the game is expecting a different phrasing. Let me think about the possible commands. In text adventures, common verbs are "take", "get", "pick up", "pick", etc. Maybe the correct command is just "take milk" without specifying the location, as the game might infer the location from the current room. Alternatively, maybe the game requires the player to use "take" with the object and the location, but the system is not accepting it. Alternatively, perhaps the game is case-sensitive, but the user is using lowercase, which is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting the player to use "get" instead of "take". Let me check the previous interactions. The user tried "take milk from floor" and "pick up milk from floor". The system's response was that it only understood the latter part. Maybe the correct command is "take milk" without the "from floor" part. Let me try that. If the user says "take milk", the game might recognize that the milk is in the garden, so the command would work. Alternatively, maybe the game requires the player to specify the location, but the system is not accepting it. 

Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting the player to use "get" instead of "take". Let me try "get milk". But the user has tried "take" and "pick up" already. The system's response was that it only understood the latter part. Maybe the correct command is "take milk" without the "from floor" part. Let me try that. So the next action would be "take milk".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in this text-based game. Their goal is to complete a series of tasks starting from the bedroom, through the kitchen, backyard, garden, and eventually reach the final goal of resting the milk on the stove.

So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, moved east to the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden where they picked up the milk. They then went north back to the backyard, west to the kitchen, and south again to the kitchen. Now they're in the kitchen again, and the next step is to rest the milk on the stove.

The current location is the kitchen, and the milk is already picked up. The task now is to put the milk on the stove. The user has to figure out the correct command to do that. The previous actions involved moving between rooms and interacting with objects like the milk. Since the milk is in the player's inventory (they picked it up), the next step would be to place it on the stove. The correct command here would be "put milk on stove" or similar. But the game's response after picking up the milk was "You pick up the milk from the ground." So the milk is now in the player's possession. Therefore, the next action should be to put it on the stove. The command should be "put milk on stove" or "rest milk on stove" as per the original instructions. The user's last action was "go south" leading back to the kitchen. Now, they need to perform the final action of putting the milk on the stove to win the game.
