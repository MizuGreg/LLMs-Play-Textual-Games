I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, ensure that the antique trunk in the bedroom is open. Then, take the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. After taking the old key, unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. And then, assure that the wooden door is wide open. After that, move east. Okay, and then, doublecheck that the screen door in the kitchen is opened. After that, travel east. That done, make an attempt to move south. After that, recover the tomato plant from the floor of the garden. Then, make an attempt to take a trip north. With that over with, go to the west. After that, sit the tomato plant on the stove inside the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just walked into a bedroom.

You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a chest drawer. What's that over there? It looks like it's an antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, and tried to unlock the wooden door. But the system kept saying it didn't understand the sentence. Then the user tried "unlock wooden door in bedroom" again, and the same error.

Hmm, maybe the correct command is "unlock the wooden door" without "in the bedroom" part? Or maybe "unlock the door" since the door is already mentioned as being in the bedroom. Wait, the original instruction was to "unlock the wooden door in the bedroom." But the system might be expecting a different phrasing. Let me check the previous interactions.

The user first tried "unlock wooden door in bedroom" and got an error. Then they tried "unlock the wooden door in the bedroom" again, still getting the same error. Maybe the game expects the command to be "unlock the door" or "unlock the wooden door" without specifying "in the bedroom" because the context is already the bedroom. Alternatively, maybe "open the wooden door" instead of unlock? But the original task was to unlock it.

Wait, the user's initial task was to "unlock the wooden door in the bedroom." So the correct command should be "unlock the wooden door in the bedroom." But the system keeps saying it doesn't understand. Maybe the game's parser is case-sensitive or expects a different wording. Alternatively, maybe the door is already unlocked, but the user needs to open it. But the task says to unlock it.

Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "unlock the door" since the door is in the bedroom. Let me think. The user is in the bedroom, and the door is there. So perhaps the correct command is "unlock the door" without specifying "wooden" or "in the bedroom." But the original instruction specifically says "wooden door in the bedroom," so maybe the game expects that exact phrasing. But the user has tried that and got errors.

Alternatively, maybe the game uses different verbs. For example, "open the wooden door" instead of unlock. But the task says to unlock. Maybe the user needs to use "unlock" but the game expects "open." But the original instruction says to unlock. This is confusing.

Wait, the user's previous action was "take old key from antique trunk," which worked. Then "unlock wooden door in bedroom" didn't work. Maybe the game is expecting "unlock the wooden door" without "in the bedroom" because the context is already the bedroom. Let me try that. So the next action should be "unlock the wooden door." Maybe the "in the bedroom" part is redundant here.

Alternatively, maybe the game requires the user to use "unlock the door" since the door is in the bedroom. But the original instruction says "wooden door," so maybe the correct command is "unlock the wooden door." Let's try that. If that doesn't work, maybe the user needs to use "open" instead of "unlock." But the task says to unlock. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the game is expecting the user to use "unlock" but with the correct object. So the correct command is "unlock the wooden door." Let's try that. If that's not working, maybe the user needs to use "open" instead. But the original task says to unlock. I think the correct command here is "unlock the wooden door." Let's proceed with that.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game and has followed a series of steps. They've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, opened it, and moved east to the kitchen. Now they need to check the screen door in the kitchen.

The user has been getting some feedback where their commands were misunderstood, like "check screen door in kitchen" was only partially understood. But the system is now giving a response where the screen door is closed. The next step according to the original task was to double-check that the screen door in the kitchen is opened. Wait, but in the current state, the screen door is closed. So maybe the user needs to open it?

Wait, looking back at the original instructions: "doublecheck that the screen door in the kitchen is opened. After that, travel east." So the user needs to make sure the screen door is open. If it's closed, they need to open it. But in the current state, the screen door is closed. So the next action should be to open the screen door.

But the user's last command was "check screen door in kitchen", which the system responded to by saying the screen door is closed. So the next step is to open it. Then, after opening, travel east again. But the user's next action should be "open screen door in kitchen".

But the user is asking if they're on the right track. The score is at 5/6, so they need to proceed. The next step is to open the screen door, then go east. So the correct command here is "open screen door in kitchen".

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a set of instructions in the TextWorld game. They've been moving through rooms, opening doors, and interacting with objects. The current challenge is in the kitchen, where they need to check and open the screen door.

The user has been repeatedly trying to tell the game to "open screen door in kitchen," but the game only understands "open screen door." Maybe the game's parser is strict about the exact phrasing. The user's previous attempts were getting feedback that the game didn't understand the sentence, so they need to adjust their commands to match what the game expects.

Looking at the game's response after the user said "open screen door in kitchen," the game says, "I only understood you as far as wanting to open screen door." This suggests that the game is accepting "open screen door" but not the full phrase. So the user needs to simplify their command to just "open screen door" without the "in kitchen" part, since the game might already know they're in the kitchen.

The user's next action should be to try "open screen door" again, as that's the exact command the game understands. Even though the user's original instruction was to check the screen door first, the game might require opening it as part of the process. The user needs to follow the game's expected commands strictly to progress.

Also, the user is asking if they're on the right track. Based on the score increments and the steps completed so far, they seem to be following the correct sequence. The next steps after opening the screen door would be moving east, then trying to go south, etc. So the user is close to reaching the goal, but needs to ensure each command is exactly as the game expects.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow a series of steps in the TextWorld game. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door in the bedroom, then moved east to the kitchen, checked and opened the screen door, then went east again to the backyard, and finally south to the garden.

In the garden, the user's goal is to recover the tomato plant from the floor. The previous attempt was "recover tomato plant from floor of garden," which the system didn't recognize. Then the user tried "take tomato plant from floor," but the system said they can't see any such thing. 

Hmm, maybe the correct command is "take tomato plant" without specifying the floor, or perhaps "pick up tomato plant." But the game's response indicates that the tomato plant is on the floor, so the user needs to take it. The error might be in the phrasing. The user might need to use "take tomato plant" instead of "take tomato plant from floor." Alternatively, maybe "get tomato plant" or "pick up tomato plant." But the system's previous response said "You can't see any such thing," so maybe the plant isn't visible, but it's there. Wait, the description says "a tomato plant, a milk and a shovel on the floor." So the plant is there. The user needs to take it. The correct command might be "take tomato plant" or "pick up tomato plant." The user tried "take tomato plant from floor," which might be incorrect because the plant is already on the floor, so the command should just be "take tomato plant." Let me check the previous steps. The user's last action was "recover tomato plant from floor of garden," which didn't work. Then they tried "take tomato plant from floor," which also didn't work. So maybe the correct command is "take tomato plant" without the "from floor" part. Alternatively, maybe "get tomato plant." But the system's response was "You can't see any such thing," which suggests that the plant isn't in the inventory or visible. Wait, but the description says it's on the floor. Maybe the correct command is "take tomato plant" or "pick up tomato plant." The user needs to try that. So the next action should be "take tomato plant."
