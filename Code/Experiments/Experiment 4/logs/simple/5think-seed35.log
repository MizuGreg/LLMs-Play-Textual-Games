Welcome to TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First thing I need you to do is to open the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. With the old key, insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. After that, ensure that the wooden door is open. Then, try to go east. After that, open the refrigerator. After that, recover the tomato plant from the refrigerator. If you can get your hands on the tomato plant, sit the tomato plant on the stove in the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. An usual kind of place.

A closed chest drawer is in the room. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an antique trunk. Huh, weird. What's that over there? It looks like it's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. But the thing is empty.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

<think>
Okay, let me see. The user is playing this text-based game and has reached the point where they've unlocked the wooden door. The original goal was to open the chest drawer, get the old key, unlock the door, go east, open the fridge, get the tomato plant, put it on the stove, and then stop.

So far, they've done the first three steps: opened the chest drawer, took the key, and unlocked the door. The next step according to the instructions was to "ensure that the wooden door is open," which they've done. Then they needed to "try to go east." The user's last action was unlocking the door, so the next logical step is to go east. 

The user's previous attempt to "insert old key into wooden door's lock" was corrected to "unlock wooden door with old key," which worked. Now, after unlocking, the next command should be "go east." The user needs to move east from the bedroom through the unlocked door. 

The user's current location is the bedroom, and the wooden door leading east is now open. So the next action is to go east. The user hasn't done that yet, so the correct command here is "go east." The user's score is at 3/4, so they're halfway there. They need to proceed to the next rooms, open the fridge, get the tomato plant, etc. 

I need to make sure the command is correct. The user has to go east from the current room (bedroom) through the unlocked door. So the next action is definitely "go east."

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in the game because they keep trying to go east but the wooden door needs to be opened first. They've already unlocked the door with the old key, but maybe they didn't open it yet. Wait, the previous interaction shows that after inserting the key into the lock, the door was unlocked, but maybe the action required is to open it instead of just unlocking. Let me check the game's logic.

The user tried "unlock wooden door with old key" but the game says "That's unlocked at the moment." So maybe the correct action is to open the door after unlocking. But the game might consider "unlock" and "open" as different steps. Alternatively, maybe the door is locked, and inserting the key unlocks it, but you still need to open it. However, the user already has the key and inserted it, so the door should be open. But the game is preventing them from going east until the door is open. 

Wait, the user's previous action was "unlock wooden door with old key", which the game acknowledged as unlocking. But the door might still be locked, and the user needs to open it. However, the game's message says "That's unlocked at the moment," so maybe the door is indeed unlocked. But the user can't go east unless the door is open. Maybe the game considers "unlocked" and "open" as separate states. So even though the door is unlocked, it's still closed, and the user needs to open it. 

Alternatively, maybe the game's parser is strict. The correct action after inserting the key is to "open the wooden door" instead of "unlock". But the user tried "unlock" and the game didn't accept it. So perhaps the correct command is "open wooden door". Let me check the previous steps again. 

The user inserted the key into the lock, and the game said "You unlock wooden door." Then the user tried "unlock again", but the game said "That's unlocked at the moment." So maybe the door is now unlocked but still closed. The user needs to open it. So the next action should be "open wooden door". But the user tried "go east" again, which is why the game is blocking. So the correct next step is to open the door, then go east. 

But the user is confused because they thought the door was unlocked. So the answer is to open the door, then proceed east. However, the game might require the exact command. So the next action should be "open wooden door".

You are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a refrigerator. You make out a counter. The counter is standard. The counter appears to be empty. You make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove! oh well. You can see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is normal. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going south.
