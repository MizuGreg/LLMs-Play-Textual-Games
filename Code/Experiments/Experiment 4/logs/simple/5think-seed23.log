You are now playing a profound session of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, ensure that the antique trunk is open. And then, recover the old key from the antique trunk in the bedroom. Then, check that the wooden door is unlocked with the old key. Then, open the wooden door. And then, move east. And then, make absolutely sure that the screen door is open. Having opened the screen door, attempt to head east. With that done, move south. Then, retrieve the apple from the floor of the garden. And then, make an attempt to venture north. If you can succeed at that, head west. With that accomplished, sit the apple on the stove inside the kitchen. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in a bedroom.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a chest drawer, so there's that. You make out a closed antique trunk in the corner. You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps in the TextWorld game. They started by opening the antique trunk, taking the old key, unlocking the wooden door, and opening it. Now they're at the bedroom again, and the next step according to the initial instructions was to move east.

Wait, after opening the wooden door, the next step was to move east. The user just opened the door, so the next logical step would be to go east. But the user's last action was opening the wooden door, and the current location is probably outside the bedroom now. So moving east from there would take them to the next room. Then, after moving east, they need to make sure the screen door is open. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the user's last action was opening the wooden door, so the next step should be moving east. The user's next command should be "go east" to proceed. Let me check the previous steps again to confirm. The initial plan was: after opening the door, move east, then check the screen door. So yes, the next action is to go east.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just shown up in a kitchen.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a refrigerator. You make out a counter. But there isn't a thing on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You make out a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

Okay, so you're in a backyard, cool, but is it ordinary? You better believe it is. The room is well lit.

You scan the room for a set of chairs, and you find a set of chairs. The set of chairs appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You see a bbq. The bbq is normal. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio table. The patio table is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the original instructions. They started by opening the antique trunk, taking the key, unlocking and opening the wooden door, then moving east to the kitchen. Then they had to open the screen door before going east again, which led them to the backyard. Now they're in the garden, and the next step according to the original plan was to retrieve the apple from the floor of the garden.

Looking at the current scene in the garden, there's a lettuce, tomato plant, apple, and shovel on the floor. So the apple is already there. The next step mentioned was to take the apple. The user's next action should be to pick up the apple. The command would be "take apple". After that, they needed to venture north, but since the user is in the garden, moving north would take them back to the backyard or maybe another area. But according to the original plan, after getting the apple, they had to go north, then west, sit the apple on the stove in the kitchen. So the immediate next step is to take the apple. The user has already reached the garden, so "take apple" is the correct command here.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps in the TextWorld game. They started by opening the antique trunk, retrieving the key, unlocking and opening the wooden door, then moving east. They encountered the kitchen, opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden where they picked up the apple. Then they went north back to the backyard, west to the kitchen, then east again to the kitchen, and now they're back in the kitchen again.

The original goal was to retrieve the apple from the garden, put it on the stove in the kitchen, and then win. The user has already picked up the apple in the garden. The next step mentioned in the original instructions was to "venture north" from the garden, which they did, leading them back through the backyard and kitchen. Now, they're in the kitchen again. The next step after getting the apple was to "sit the apple on the stove inside the kitchen." So the current location is the kitchen, and the apple is in the player's inventory. The stove is in the kitchen, so the next action should be to put the apple on the stove. The correct command would be "put apple on stove" or similar. But in the game's context, the exact phrasing might matter. Since the user has the apple, they need to place it on the stove. The previous steps show that the stove is present, so the next action is to put the apple there. The user's last action was going east again, but now they need to interact with the stove. So the next command should be to put the apple on the stove.
