I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First of all, you could, like, ensure that the antique trunk in the bedroom is open. Then, take the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. After taking the old key, unlock the wooden door in the bedroom. And then, assure that the wooden door is wide open. After that, move east. Okay, and then, doublecheck that the screen door in the kitchen is opened. After that, travel east. That done, make an attempt to move south. After that, recover the tomato plant from the floor of the garden. Then, make an attempt to take a trip north. With that over with, go to the west. After that, sit the tomato plant on the stove inside the kitchen. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just walked into a bedroom.

You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a chest drawer. What's that over there? It looks like it's an antique trunk. You can see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is usual. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is having trouble with the game. They've been trying to unlock the wooden door in the bedroom, but every time they try to say "unlock wooden door in bedroom," the system says they didn't understand it. Wait, maybe the correct command is different. Let me check the previous interactions.

Earlier, the user tried "unlock wooden door in bedroom" and the system kept saying it didn't understand. But the user had previously used "unlock the wooden door in the bedroom" which worked once. Wait, no, the first time the user tried "unlock wooden door in bedroom" and the system said it didn't understand. Then the user tried "unlock the wooden door in the bedroom" and it worked? Or did it not? Let me check the history.

Looking back: The user first tried "unlock wooden door in bedroom" and the system said "I didn't understand that sentence." Then the user tried "unlock the wooden door in the bedroom" and the system said the same. Then the user tried "unlock wooden door in bedroom" again, and the system said the same. So maybe the correct command is "unlock the wooden door" or "unlock door".

Alternatively, maybe the system is expecting a different phrasing. The original instruction was to "unlock the wooden door in the bedroom." Maybe the correct command is "unlock the wooden door" since the location is already implied as the bedroom. Or perhaps "unlock door" without specifying. But the user has to be precise.

Wait, the user's previous action was "take old key from antique trunk" which worked. Then "unlock wooden door in bedroom" didn't work. Maybe the correct command is "unlock the wooden door" without the "in the bedroom" part because the user is already in the bedroom. Alternatively, maybe "unlock door" is sufficient.

Alternatively, maybe the system is expecting "open the wooden door" instead of "unlock". But the original task was to unlock the door. So perhaps the correct command is "unlock the wooden door".

But the user has tried that multiple times and the system keeps saying it didn't understand. Maybe the system is expecting a different verb, like "use the old key to unlock the wooden door" or something similar. But the user has the key, so maybe they need to use it.

Wait, the user has the old key. So maybe the correct action is "use old key on wooden door" or "use key to unlock door". But the system might expect "unlock the wooden door" with the key. Alternatively, maybe the key is already in hand, so the command is just "unlock the wooden door".

Alternatively, maybe the system is case-sensitive. The user tried "unlock wooden door in bedroom" and the system said it didn't understand. Maybe the correct command is "unlock the wooden door in the bedroom" with "the" added. But the user tried that and it didn't work. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the system is expecting "open the wooden door" instead of "unlock". But the original task was to unlock it. Maybe the user needs to use the key to unlock it. So the correct command would be "use old key to unlock wooden door".

But the user hasn't tried that yet. Let me check the previous steps. The user has the old key. So maybe the correct action is to use the key to unlock the door. So the command would be "use old key to unlock wooden door" or "use key to unlock wooden door".

But the system might not accept that. Alternatively, maybe the correct command is "unlock wooden door" because the key is already in hand. But the system keeps saying it doesn't understand. Maybe the system is expecting "open the wooden door" even though the task is to unlock it. But the user's original instruction was to unlock the door. So perhaps the correct command is "unlock the wooden door".

Alternatively, maybe the system is expecting "open the wooden door" as the action, and the key is used to do that. But the user's task is to unlock it, so maybe the correct command is "unlock the wooden door".

But the user has tried that multiple times and the system keeps saying it didn't understand. Maybe the system is expecting a different phrasing. Let me think again.

The user is in the bedroom, and the wooden door is closed. The user has the old key. The correct action is to unlock the door. So the command should be "unlock the wooden door in the bedroom" but maybe without "in the bedroom" since the user is already there. Or maybe "unlock the wooden door".

Alternatively, maybe the system is expecting "open the wooden door" instead of "unlock". But the original task says to unlock it. Maybe the user needs to use the key to unlock it. So the correct command is "use old key to unlock wooden door".

But the user hasn't tried that yet. Let me check the previous steps again. The user has the key, so maybe the correct action is to use the key to unlock the door. Therefore, the next command should be "use old key to unlock wooden door".

You can see a stove. The stove is ordinary. But the thing is empty. You see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text adventure game. They've been following a set of steps to open a trunk, get a key, unlock a door, and then move east to the kitchen. So far, they've successfully opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and opened it. Then they moved east to the kitchen.

In the kitchen, the user needs to double-check that the screen door is open. The previous attempt was to "doublecheck screen door in kitchen," but the system didn't recognize it. The user then tried "check screen door in kitchen," which was partially understood. Now, the user is asking if they're on the right track and needs the next action.

The original task was to first ensure the antique trunk is open, take the key, unlock the door, open it, move east, check the screen door, move east again, try to go south, get the tomato plant from the garden, move north, go west, and then put the plant on the stove. 

Currently, in the kitchen, the user has to check the screen door. The correct command here would be "open screen door" or "check screen door." Since the user previously tried "check screen door in kitchen" and it was partially understood, maybe the system expects a simpler command like "open screen door" or "check screen door." The user's next action should be to confirm the screen door is open. Since the kitchen's description mentions the screen door is closed, the user needs to open it. So the next step is to open the screen door. Then move east again. But the user's next action should be to open the screen door. The system might accept "open screen door" as the command.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in the TextWorld game. Their goal is to complete a set of tasks, starting from the bedroom, then moving through the kitchen, backyard, and finally the garden. So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, moved east to the kitchen, checked and opened the screen door, went east again to the backyard, and then south to the garden.

In the garden, the current state shows a bell pepper, a tomato plant, milk, and a shovel on the floor. The next task mentioned in the original instructions was to "recover the tomato plant from the floor of the garden." So the immediate next action should be to pick up the tomato plant. The user is at the garden now, so the correct command would be "take tomato plant" or "pick up tomato plant." However, in the game's context, the exact phrasing might matter. Since the user has been using commands like "open" and "take," it's likely that "take tomato plant" is the right command here. After taking it, they need to move north, then west, and finally place the plant on the stove in the kitchen. But the next step is definitely to take the tomato plant from the floor.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started in the bedroom, opened the trunk, took the key, unlocked the door, and then moved east to the kitchen. They checked the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden. In the garden, they took the tomato plant.

Now, the next step according to the original task was to "sit the tomato plant on the stove inside the kitchen." The user is currently in the garden with the tomato plant. So the next logical steps would be to go back to the kitchen and place the plant on the stove.

But first, they need to move from the garden back to the kitchen. The garden's description mentions an unblocked exit to the north, which likely leads back to the backyard, and then from there back to the kitchen. However, the user might need to check the directions again. The garden has an exit to the north (backyard) and possibly other directions. Since the user is in the garden, the next step would be to go north back to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. But the user might not need to go through the backyard again. Let me check the previous steps.

Wait, the user was in the garden after going south from the backyard. The garden's exit to the north is unblocked, so going north would take them back to the backyard. Then from the backyard, the screen door west leads back to the kitchen. So the path is garden -> north -> backyard -> west -> kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can place the tomato plant on the stove.

But the user is currently in the garden with the tomato plant. The next action should be to go north to the backyard. Then west to the kitchen. Once in the kitchen, they can put the tomato plant on the stove. However, the user's last action was taking the tomato plant from the garden. The next step is to move back to the kitchen. So the immediate next command should be "go north" to return to the backyard, then "go west" to the kitchen. But the user can only input one command at a time. Since the user is in the garden, the first step is to go north to the backyard. Then, from there, go west to the kitchen. But the user's current location is the garden, so the next command is "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user has been following a series of steps in the TextWorld game. Their goal was to perform a series of actions starting from the bedroom, then moving through the kitchen, backyard, and garden, and finally placing the tomato plant on the stove in the kitchen.

So far, they've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, moved east to the kitchen, double-checked the screen door, went east again to the backyard, then south to the garden where they took the tomato plant. They then went north back to the backyard and west to the kitchen.

Now, the next step according to the original task was to "sit the tomato plant on the stove inside the kitchen." The user is currently in the kitchen again. They have the tomato plant in hand, as they picked it up in the garden and moved it to the kitchen. The stove is in the kitchen, so the next logical action is to place the tomato plant on the stove.

The user's last action was "go west," which brought them back to the kitchen. Now, they need to put the tomato plant on the stove. The correct command here would be "put tomato plant on stove." That should complete the task and move them closer to the goal.
