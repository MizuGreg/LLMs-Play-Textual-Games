I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! First off, assure that the antique trunk within the bedroom is open. And then, take the old key from the antique trunk inside the bedroom. Once you have got the old key, doublecheck that the wooden door is unlocked. And then, open the wooden door. Once you have pulled open the wooden door, attempt to venture east. That done, make sure that the refrigerator is open. Then, recover the lettuce from the refrigerator in the kitchen. If you can get your hands on the lettuce, place the lettuce on the stove in the kitchen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You've just walked into a bedroom.

You can see a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. What's that over there? It looks like it's a king-size bed. The king-size bed is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me see. The user has been following the steps in the TextWorld game. They started by opening the antique trunk in the bedroom, taking the old key, unlocking the wooden door, and opening it. Now they're in the next room, which is the kitchen, I assume.

The next steps according to the original instructions were to make sure the refrigerator is open, take the lettuce from it, place the lettuce on the stove, and then win. So the current goal is to check the refrigerator. The user needs to open the refrigerator first. Since they're in the kitchen now, after opening the door, the next logical step is to go to the refrigerator. But the user's last action was opening the wooden door, which led them to the kitchen. Now they need to interact with the refrigerator.

Wait, the user's last message was asking if they're on the right track. The assistant needs to respond with the next action. The next step is to check if the refrigerator is open. If it's closed, they need to open it. But the user hasn't mentioned the refrigerator yet. So the correct next action would be to open the refrigerator. But the user might have to first navigate to the refrigerator's location. However, in TextWorld, sometimes you can interact with objects directly. So maybe the next command is "open refrigerator" or "open the refrigerator". But the user's previous actions were "open wooden door", so after that, they are in the kitchen. The next step is to open the refrigerator. So the correct command here is "open refrigerator".

GAME ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see a refrigerator. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is usual. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can make out a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
