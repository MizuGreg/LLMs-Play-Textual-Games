Welcome to another exciting round of TextWorld! First of all, ensure that the antique trunk is open. After opening the antique trunk, take the old key from the antique trunk. And then, unlock the wooden door in the bedroom with the old key. And then, open the wooden door. Then, make an attempt to travel east. Okay, and then, doublecheck that the refrigerator is wide open. Once you have opened the refrigerator, take the bell pepper from the refrigerator. After that, rest the bell pepper on the stove inside the kitchen. That's it!

-= Bedroom =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a bedroom.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a chest drawer. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You see an antique trunk. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a king-size bed. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

You arrive in a kitchen.

You make out a closed refrigerator. You can see a counter. The counter is typical. The counter appears to be empty. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a kitchen island. The kitchen island is typical. On the kitchen island you see a note.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has followed a set of steps to reach the kitchen. They've opened the antique trunk, taken the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door to go east into the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, they need to check the refrigerator, take the bell pepper, put it on the stove, and then maybe proceed further.

The current location is the kitchen. The user's next step should be to open the refrigerator. The prompt mentions that after opening the refrigerator, they need to take the bell pepper from it. So the immediate action here is to open the refrigerator. The user has already reached the kitchen, so the next logical step is to interact with the refrigerator.

Looking at the environment description, the refrigerator is closed. The user needs to open it. The previous actions involved opening doors and trunks, so following that pattern, the next command should be "open refrigerator". That makes sense. After that, they can take the bell pepper. But the user's next move is to open the refrigerator. So the correct command here is "open refrigerator".
