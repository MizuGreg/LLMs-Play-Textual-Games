It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First step, open the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer in the bedroom. If you can get your hands on the old key, insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After that, travel east. Then, open the screen door. Then, go to the east. Then, attempt to travel south. If you can manage that, lift the lettuce from the floor of the garden. And then, head north. Then, try to travel west. Following that, rest the lettuce on the stove. That's it!

Okay, so you're in a bedroom, cool, but is it standard? You better believe it is.

Hey, want to see a chest drawer? Look over there, a chest drawer. Oh, great. Here's an antique trunk. You see a king-size bed. The king-size bed is typical. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to reach the goal. So far, they've opened the chest drawer, taken the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and tried to go east. But the game told them they need to open the wooden door first before going east.

Wait, the user just tried to go east after unlocking the door. But the response said they have to open the wooden door first. Hmm, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, took the key, inserted it into the door's lock, and then unlocked the door. Then they tried to go east. But the game's response said they need to open the wooden door first. Oh, maybe "unlock" and "open" are different actions here. Maybe after unlocking, they need to open the door to actually pass through it. So the next step should be to open the door after unlocking it. But the user already unlocked it, so maybe the door is now open, and they can proceed east.

Wait, the game's message said "You unlock wooden door." Then the user tried to go east, but the game responded that they need to open the door first. That's confusing. Maybe the game expects them to open the door instead of unlocking it. Or perhaps there's a step missing. Let me think about the original instructions.

The original instructions said: insert the old key into the wooden door's lock to unlock it. Then ensure the wooden door is open. So after unlocking, they need to open it. Maybe "unlock" is different from "open". So the user has to first unlock the door, then open it. But in the game, after unlocking, the door is already open? Or maybe the user needs to explicitly open it after unlocking.

In the current state, the user has unlocked the door, but the game says they need to open it first. So the next action should be to open the wooden door. Then, after that, they can go east. So the correct next step is to open the door again. But wait, the user already unlocked it. Maybe the game requires them to open it, which might be a separate action. So the user should first open the door, then go east.

But the user tried to go east after unlocking, and the game said they need to open the door first. So the next action should be to open the wooden door. Let me check the previous steps again.

The user's last action was "go east", which the game responded with "You have to open the wooden door first." So the next step is to open the door. Therefore, the correct command is "open wooden door".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete a goal. The original goal was to lift the lettuce from the garden and then rest it on the stove, but so far, the player has been moving through different rooms like the bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the bathroom again, and the next action suggested is to go south, which would take them back to the kitchen. But the user is asking if they're on the right track and if they're close to the goal. 

Wait, the original steps mentioned going east after opening the door, then opening the screen door, going east again, traveling south to the garden, lifting the lettuce, then going north, west, and resting the lettuce on the stove. So far, the player has only moved between rooms without actually reaching the garden or the lettuce. 

The current position is the bathroom, which isn't part of the original path. The user might have gotten stuck in a loop between the kitchen and bathroom. The next step should be to proceed towards the garden. But in the current setup, the kitchen has a screen door leading east, which might be the way to go. However, the user has been going back and forth between kitchen and bathroom. 

Wait, in the kitchen, there's a screen door leading east. Maybe that's the way to the garden. The user needs to go east from the kitchen, open the screen door, then proceed to the garden. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to go east from the kitchen, open the screen door, then move south to the garden. 

But the user is currently in the bathroom, so going south would take them back to the kitchen. Then from the kitchen, go east to open the screen door. Then maybe go south from there to reach the garden. 

So the correct next step is to go south from the bathroom back to the kitchen, then east to the screen door, then south to the garden. But the user is in the bathroom, so the immediate next action is to go south to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, go east to open the screen door. 

But the user's last action was going north to the bathroom, and now they're in the bathroom again. The next step should be to go south back to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, proceed east to the screen door. Then, after opening it, go south to the garden. 

So the user is currently in the bathroom, so the next action is to go south to the kitchen. Then, from the kitchen, go east to the screen door. Then, after opening it, go south to the garden. Then, lift the lettuce. 

But the user's current position is the bathroom, so the next action is to go south. Therefore, the answer should be "go south".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete a goal. From the previous interactions, they've been moving between rooms: bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, and back and forth. The goal mentioned initially was to get the old key, unlock the door, and then proceed to the garden to lift the lettuce and rest it on the stove.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the kitchen again, and the score is at 5/15. The key steps they've completed so far include opening the chest drawer, taking the old key, unlocking the wooden door, and going east. However, they've been stuck in a loop between the kitchen and bathroom, moving back and forth without making progress towards the garden or the lettuce.

The next logical step after the kitchen would be to try opening the screen door leading east, as mentioned in the kitchen description. The user hasn't tried that yet. Once they open the screen door, they can move east to the garden, where they need to lift the lettuce from the floor and then rest it on the stove. Since the user hasn't done that yet, the correct action now is to open the screen door east. That makes sense because the screen door is closed, and opening it would allow them to proceed to the next part of the game. The user might be missing this step because they're focused on the doors they've already passed, but the screen door is the next unopened barrier. So the next command should be "open screen door".

In the garden, the user tried "lift lettuce from floor of garden" but got an error. The system said that's not a recognized verb. So maybe the correct command is just "lift lettuce" or "take lettuce". The user might be using a more detailed phrase than what the game accepts.

Looking at the previous actions, the user used commands like "open chest drawer", "take old key from chest drawer", "insert old key into wooden door's lock", etc. The game seems to expect concise commands without extra words. So "lift lettuce" might be the correct command here instead of the more detailed version.

Also, after lifting the lettuce, the next step is to go north and then rest the lettuce on the stove. But first, the user needs to successfully lift the lettuce. Since the previous attempt failed, the user needs to try a simpler command. The next action should be "lift lettuce" to proceed.

You've just sauntered into a backyard.

You can make out a set of chairs. The set of chairs is ordinary. But the thing is empty. You see a bbq. The bbq appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bbq. You see a patio table. The patio table is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open screen door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's see. The user is playing this text-based game where they have to follow a series of steps to complete a goal. From the previous interactions, they've been moving through different rooms: bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, backyard, and garden. Their goal seems to involve collecting items and navigating through the levels.

Currently, the user is in the Backyard, and the next step according to the initial instructions was to "rest the lettuce on the stove." But the user hasn't reached the stove yet. They picked up the lettuce in the garden and now are back in the backyard. The next logical step would be to go north again to return to the kitchen or another room where the stove might be located. However, the user's last action was going south, which brought them back to the garden. Wait, no—the user just went north from the garden to the backyard again. The stove is in the kitchen, so maybe they need to go back through the kitchen to the stove. But the user is in the backyard now. The path from the backyard leads back to the kitchen via the screen door west, then possibly through the kitchen to the stove. But the user hasn't been to the kitchen in a while. Alternatively, maybe the stove is in the kitchen, so they need to go back to the kitchen. But the user is in the backyard. The previous steps show that after the garden, they went back to the backyard. The next step would be to go west through the screen door to the kitchen, then find the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. However, the initial instructions mentioned that after getting the lettuce, they should "head north" and then "try to travel west" and "rest the lettuce on the stove." So perhaps the user is supposed to go north from the garden to the backyard, then west to the kitchen, then to the stove. But the user is currently in the backyard. The next action should be to go west through the screen door to the kitchen. But the user's last action was going north, which brought them back to the backyard. So the next step is to go west to the kitchen. But the user might not have the correct path. Alternatively, maybe the stove is in the kitchen, so they need to go back to the kitchen. The user is in the backyard, so the correct next step is to go west through the screen door to the kitchen. Then, once in the kitchen, they can go north to the stove. But the user hasn't done that yet. So the next action should be to go west from the backyard to the kitchen. But the user is in the backyard, and the screen door is leading west. So the correct command is "go west" or "go through screen door west." But in the game's context, the user might need to use "go west" as the command. However, the user's previous actions have been using "go north," "go south," etc. So the next step is to go west from the backyard to the kitchen. Then, in the kitchen, they can proceed to the stove. But the user hasn't reached the stove yet. So the correct next action is to go west through the screen door to the kitchen. Therefore, the answer should be "go west."

-= Kitchen =-
Look at that placard! What does it say? It says Welcome to the kitchen? Well that's cool. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can see a closed refrigerator close by. You can make out a counter. The counter is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well Were you looking for a kitchen island? Because look over there, it's a kitchen island. On the kitchen island you can see a note.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unblocked. There is an unguarded exit to the south.
