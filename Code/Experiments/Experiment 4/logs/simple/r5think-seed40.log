Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First stop, ensure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is open. And then, pick up the old key from the chest drawer. After that, make absolutely sure that the wooden door is unlocked. Then, ensure that the wooden door is open. After that, venture east. After that, move south. That done, take the bell pepper from the couch in the living room. Then, go north. Then, rest the bell pepper on the stove inside the kitchen. Alright, thanks!

-= Bedroom =-
Well, here we are in the bedroom.

You can make out a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. However, the king-size bed, like an empty king-size bed, has nothing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the instructions. First, they opened the chest drawer and picked up the old key. Now, the next step according to the initial instructions was to make sure the wooden door is unlocked. So, I need to figure out how to unlock the door.

Wait, the user has the old key. Maybe using the key on the door would unlock it. The door is closed and leading east. So the next action should be to unlock the door with the key. Let me check the previous steps again. The user has the key now, so the next logical step is to unlock the door. Then, after unlocking, they need to open the door. So the next command should be to unlock the wooden door with the old key. Let me make sure that's the correct action here.

-= Kitchen =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the kitchen.

You see a closed refrigerator right there by you. You scan the room, seeing a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a kitchen island. The kitchen island is standard. On the kitchen island you make out a note. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unguarded. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps given in the initial instructions. They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. Now they're in the kitchen, and the next step according to the original plan was to move south after venturing east and then moving south. But wait, in the current scene, the user is in the kitchen, and the available directions are east (closed screen door), west (open wooden door back to bedroom), north (exit), and south (unblocked). The original plan said after going east (which they did), they should move south. So the next action should be to go south. But let me check the current location again. The user is in the kitchen, and the next step is to move south. However, the kitchen's description mentions that moving south is unblocked. So the correct next step is to go south. The user's previous action was going east, and now they need to go south. The score is at 5/6, so they need to proceed accordingly. The answer should be "go south".
</think>go south

-= Living Room =-
You are in a living room. A normal kind of place.

Oh, great. Here's a couch. The couch is typical. On the couch you can see a bell pepper. You see a low table. You see a remote on the low table. You can make out a tv! The tv is usual. However, the tv, like an empty tv, has nothing on it. You move on, clearly upset with your TextWorld experience.

You need an unguarded exit? You should try going north.

Okay, let's see. The user has been following the steps to open the chest drawer, get the key, unlock and open the wooden door, go east to the kitchen, then south to the living room. Now they're in the living room, where there's a bell pepper on the couch. The next step according to the original instructions was to take the bell pepper from the couch, then go north, rest it on the stove in the kitchen.

Wait, the user just arrived in the living room, and the current step is to take the bell pepper. The previous action was going south, which led them here. So the next command should be to take the bell pepper. But the user's last input was "go south", which brought them to the living room. Now, the next action should be "take bell pepper" to pick it up. Then, after that, they need to go north to the kitchen and rest it on the stove. But the user's next move should be taking the bell pepper now. The assistant should output "take bell pepper" as the next command.

The original instructions said after taking the bell pepper, they should go north, then rest the bell pepper on the stove in the kitchen. So the next action should be going north. But let me check the current environment description again.

In the Living Room, the user is told that there's an unguarded exit to the north. So the next step is to go north. The user hasn't done that yet. So the correct command here is "go north". The user needs to move to the kitchen again to place the bell pepper on the stove. The previous steps have been followed correctly up to this point. So the next action is definitely "go north".

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game, and they've followed the steps given. Let me recap the current state.

They started in the bedroom, opened the chest drawer, picked up the old key, unlocked and opened the wooden door, then went east to the kitchen. From the kitchen, they went south to the living room, took the bell pepper, and then went north back to the kitchen. Now, they're in the kitchen again, at 7/9 points.

The next step according to the original instructions was to rest the bell pepper on the stove in the kitchen. But the user hasn't done that yet. The current location is the kitchen, which has a stove, so that's the next logical step. The user needs to place the bell pepper on the stove. The previous action was going north, which brought them back to the kitchen. So the next command should be to put the bell pepper on the stove. Let me check if that's possible. The stove is in the kitchen, and the user is holding the bell pepper. So the correct action is to put it on the stove. The user's next move should be "put bell pepper on stove".
