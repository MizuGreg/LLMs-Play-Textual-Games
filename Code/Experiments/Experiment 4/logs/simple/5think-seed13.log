I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First, it would be great if you could ensure that the chest drawer within the bedroom is open. And then, retrieve the old key from the chest drawer. And then, unlock the wooden door with the old key. And then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. And then, make an attempt to go east. And then, open the screen door. After opening the screen door, make an effort to go to the east. Then, take a trip south. And then, retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. If you can get your hands on the bell pepper, head north. Then, travel west. After that, rest the bell pepper on the stove. Got that? Good!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a chest drawer. You can see a closed antique trunk. You make out a king-size bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me figure out what to do next. The user is in the bedroom in TextWorld. They've already opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and now they need to ensure the door is open. The previous attempt to "ensure wooden door is open" was rejected because it's not a valid verb.

So, the next step should be to open the door. Since the door was just unlocked, maybe it's already open. But the instruction says to "ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open." The correct action here would be to "open the wooden door." Let me check the previous steps again.

After unlocking the door, the user tried "ensure wooden door is open" which didn't work. The correct command should be "open wooden door." Let me confirm that. The user has to open the door, maybe it's locked again or needs to be opened manually. So the next action should be "open wooden door."

You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has been moving between rooms. Their goal seems to be retrieving the bell pepper from the garden and then doing some actions involving the stove. So far, they've gone through the bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, and back to the kitchen.

The current score is 5/9, and they're in the bathroom again. The next step mentioned in their original plan was to go east from the kitchen, open the screen door, go east again, then go south to the garden to get the bell pepper. But they've been looping between kitchen and bathroom, which might not be efficient.

Wait, in the kitchen, there's a screen door leading east. The user tried going north from the kitchen, which took them to the bathroom, then back. Maybe they need to focus on the screen door in the kitchen. The original plan said after opening the screen door, go east again. But the user hasn't opened the screen door yet. So the next logical step would be to open the screen door, then go east to the garden. Then retrieve the bell pepper and proceed as planned. Since the user is in the kitchen again, the next action should be to open the screen door.

Okay, let's see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has been moving between rooms. Their goal seems to be to retrieve the bell pepper from the garden and then rest it on the stove. So far, they've been going back and forth between the bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom, which might not be the most efficient path.

The user's current location is the bathroom, and they just tried going south again. The score is at 5/13, which suggests they haven't completed the main objectives yet. The original plan was to go east from the bedroom, open the screen door, go east again, then south, retrieve the bell pepper, and so on. But they've been stuck in a loop between the kitchen and bathroom.

Maybe the user is missing a key step. For example, they need to find the garden where the bell pepper is. The screen door in the kitchen is closed, so they need to open it. But in the previous attempts, they tried going south from the bathroom and ended up back in the kitchen. They haven't yet opened the screen door east in the kitchen. Once that's done, they can proceed east to the garden.

Alternatively, maybe the user hasn't checked the kitchen island for the note mentioned earlier. The note might have important information. Also, the stove is mentioned in the kitchen, but the user hasn't interacted with it yet. However, the main goal is the bell pepper in the garden.

So the next logical step would be to open the screen door in the kitchen (east) to move towards the garden. After that, they can go east again to reach the garden, retrieve the bell pepper, and then head back to the stove. The user needs to focus on opening the screen door and proceeding east to the garden, rather than looping between bathrooms and kitchens.

Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is playing a text-based game called TextWorld, and their goal is to follow a series of steps to reach the original goal, which I assume is to retrieve the bell pepper from the garden and then do something with it, maybe cook it on the stove?

Looking at the current state, the user has been moving between the bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom, but they haven't found the garden yet. The original instructions mentioned going east from the bedroom, opening the screen door, going east again, then south, then retrieving the bell pepper from the garden. But so far, the user has only been in the bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom. The garden hasn't been accessed yet.

The user's last action was going north again, which led them back to the bathroom. The next step should be to find the garden. Since the user is in the bathroom, maybe the exit to the garden is through the kitchen's screen door. But the user tried going east from the kitchen and couldn't, maybe because the screen door is closed. The user needs to open the screen door first.

Wait, in the kitchen, there's a closed screen door leading east. The user hasn't opened that yet. The original plan was to open the screen door, go east, then go south to the garden. So the next logical step is to open the screen door in the kitchen. But the user tried going east and got a "You can't go that way" message, which probably means the screen door is closed. So the correct action here is to open the screen door first.

But in the previous steps, the user was stuck in a loop between the kitchen and bathroom. The score hasn't increased much, so maybe they need to focus on opening the screen door in the kitchen. Once that's open, they can go east to the garden, then proceed to retrieve the bell pepper and rest it on the stove. So the next action should be to open the screen door in the kitchen.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to reach the original goal. From the previous interactions, the user has been moving between rooms: bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, and back and forth. The main objective mentioned earlier was to retrieve the bell pepper from the garden, rest it on the stove, and then proceed accordingly.

Looking at the current state, the user is in the bathroom again, and the last action was "go north" which led back to the bathroom. The score is still at 5, which seems low compared to the steps mentioned in the initial instructions. The user hasn't yet reached the garden or retrieved the bell pepper. 

The key steps that haven't been completed yet are: retrieving the bell pepper from the garden, resting it on the stove, and then moving north. The user hasn't left the kitchen or bathroom to get to the garden. The screen door in the kitchen is closed, and the user hasn't tried opening it. Also, the stove is in the kitchen, so maybe after getting the bell pepper, they need to go to the stove.

But the current position is in the bathroom. The user needs to get back to the kitchen, open the screen door east, go to the garden, retrieve the bell pepper, then go north to the stove. However, the user is stuck in a loop between bathroom and kitchen. The screen door is closed, so they need to open it. The previous attempt to open the screen door from the bathroom failed because they were in the bathroom, but the screen door is in the kitchen. So the user needs to go back to the kitchen, open the screen door, then proceed east to the garden.

So the next logical step is to go back to the kitchen, open the screen door, then go east to the garden. Once there, retrieve the bell pepper, then go north to the stove. But the user is currently in the bathroom, so the next action should be to go south back to the kitchen. Then, open the screen door, go east to the garden, retrieve the bell pepper, and proceed to the stove. However, the user hasn't done any of these steps yet, so the next action should be to go south to the kitchen.

Okay, let's see. The user is stuck in a loop between the Kitchen and Bathroom, going back and forth. The original goal was to retrieve the bell pepper from the garden and then rest it on the stove. But so far, the user has only managed to get the old key, unlock the door, and move around the house.

Looking at the current location, the user is in the Kitchen again. The note on the kitchen island might be important. The screen door is closed east, and the wooden door is open west. The user tried going north and south repeatedly, which isn't helping. The key item they have is the old key, which was used to unlock the door. But the bell pepper is in the garden, which hasn't been accessed yet.

Wait, the user hasn't gone east from the kitchen yet. The screen door is closed, but maybe they need to open it. However, the user tried "open screen door" and it didn't work. Maybe there's another way to get to the garden. Alternatively, maybe the stove in the kitchen is where the bell pepper needs to be placed, but the user hasn't found it yet.

The original steps required going east after opening the screen door, then south to the garden. But the user is stuck in a loop. Perhaps the screen door needs to be opened, but the user doesn't have the key anymore. Wait, the old key was used to unlock the wooden door, but maybe the screen door requires a different key or method. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to find another way to get to the garden.

Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go west from the kitchen through the open wooden door back to the bedroom, then try another approach. But the user's score is stuck at 5, and the original goal hasn't been completed. The bell pepper is in the garden, which the user hasn't reached yet. So the next step should be to find a way to get to the garden, perhaps by opening the screen door east from the kitchen. But the user tried that and it didn't work. Maybe there's a different command needed, like "use key on screen door" or something similar. But the user hasn't tried that yet. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to go south from the kitchen to the garden directly. Wait, the kitchen has an exit to the south. Maybe that's the way to go. The user tried going south before, but maybe they need to check that path. Let me check the previous steps.

In the kitchen, the user has an exit to the south. The original plan was to go east after opening the screen door, then south to the garden. But the user hasn't gone south from the kitchen yet. Maybe the garden is accessible from the south exit of the kitchen. So the next step should be to go south from the kitchen to reach the garden, then retrieve the bell pepper. But the user has been stuck in the loop between kitchen and bathroom. So the correct next action is to go south from the kitchen.

Okay, let's try to figure out what the user is trying to do here. The original goal was to retrieve the bell pepper from the garden and then do some actions involving the stove. But the user has been moving between rooms, going back and forth between the kitchen, bathroom, and living room. The score hasn't increased much, staying at 5 out of 32.

Looking at the current location, the user is in the Bathroom again. The prompt mentions that in the Kitchen, there's a note on the kitchen island. Maybe the note has clues? But the user hasn't checked it yet. Also, the original plan was to go east after opening the screen door, but the user tried that and couldn't. Maybe the screen door is closed, so they need to open it first. But in the Bathroom, there's no screen door mentioned. Wait, the Kitchen has a closed screen door leading east. So perhaps the user needs to go back to the Kitchen, open the screen door, then go east to the garden where the bell pepper is.

But the user has been stuck in a loop between Kitchen and Bathroom. The score is low, so maybe they need to focus on completing the tasks in the Kitchen first. The note on the kitchen island might be important. Also, the stove is mentioned, and the user was supposed to rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the user hasn't found the bell pepper yet. So maybe the next step is to go east from the Kitchen through the screen door to the garden, retrieve the bell pepper, then go back.

But the user is currently in the Bathroom, so they need to go south back to the Kitchen. Then open the screen door east, go there, get the bell pepper, then return. The user's previous attempts to go east from the Bathroom failed, but once in the Kitchen, they can try opening the screen door again. So the next action should be to go south back to the Kitchen, then open the screen door, then go east to the garden. Then retrieve the bell pepper and proceed.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

Okay, let's see. The user is trying to follow the original plan, which was to retrieve the bell pepper from the floor of the garden. But when they tried to take it, the game said "You can't see any such thing." Hmm, maybe the bell pepper isn't on the floor anymore or isn't visible. Let me check the previous messages.

Looking back, after going south from the backyard, the user entered the garden. The description says there's a half of a bag of chips, an apple, a bell pepper, and a shovel on the floor. So the bell pepper should be there. But when the user tried to take it, it didn't work. Maybe the correct command is different. Instead of "take bell pepper from floor," maybe just "take bell pepper" would work because the bell pepper is on the floor. The game might automatically recognize that it's on the floor if you just take it. Let me try that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to first check the floor items. But the user already saw the items listed. So the next step should be to take the bell pepper. The error might be because the command was too specific. Let me adjust the command to just "take bell pepper" and see if that works.

-= Backyard =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so ordinary all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the backyard. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see a set of chairs. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a set of chairs, go to TextWorld. The set of chairs is usual. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You see a bbq. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You can see a patio table. Now why would someone leave that there? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

There is an open screen door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the south.

You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a refrigerator. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is ordinary. The stove appears to be empty. You can see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island.

There is an open screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an unblocked exit? You should try going north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Okay, let's see. The user is in a text-based game where they need to follow a series of steps to reach the goal. So far, they've managed to open the chest drawer, get the old key, unlock the door, open the wooden door, go east, and eventually reach the garden where they need to pick up the bell pepper. They picked it up and went north back to the backyard. Now they're in the kitchen again, and the next step is to rest the bell pepper on the stove.

Wait, the original instructions said after getting the bell pepper, they should head north, then travel west, and then rest the bell pepper on the stove. But the user is currently in the kitchen. The bell pepper is with them now. So the next logical step is to go to the stove, which is in the kitchen. The stove is mentioned in the kitchen description as being ordinary and empty. So the user needs to go to the stove and put the bell pepper there.

But how to get there? The user is in the kitchen, and the stove is part of the kitchen. So the action would be to go to the stove. However, in the game's current state, the user is in the kitchen, and the stove is already visible. So the correct command would be to "put bell pepper on stove" or something similar. But the game might require the user to first go to the stove's location. However, since the stove is in the kitchen, and the user is already there, they can directly interact with it.

Wait, the previous step was going north from the garden to the backyard, then west to the kitchen. Now, in the kitchen, the user has the bell pepper. The next step is to rest the bell pepper on the stove. So the correct action is to put the bell pepper on the stove. The game's previous interactions show that the user can pick up items and then place them. So the command should be "put bell pepper on stove".
