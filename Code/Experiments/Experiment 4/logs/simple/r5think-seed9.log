Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First, it would be good if you could open the chest drawer within the bedroom. And then, take the old key from the chest drawer within the bedroom. With the old key, unlock the wooden door. Then, ensure that the wooden door within the bedroom is open. After that, make an effort to head east. If you can accomplish that, open the refrigerator inside the kitchen. After that, recover the lettuce from the refrigerator in the kitchen. After that, rest the lettuce on the stove. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in the bedroom. Let's see what's in here.

You can make out a closed chest drawer. You see an antique trunk. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You make out a king-size bed. The king-size bed is normal. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed wooden door leading east.

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.

SELF-EVALUATION: +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
<think>
Okay, let me see. The user is playing this TextWorld game and has already completed some steps. They opened the chest drawer, took the old key, unlocked the wooden door, and then tried to go east but were told they need to open the door first. They opened the door and now the score is at 4/6.

The original goal was to open the chest drawer, take the key, unlock the door, make sure it's open, go east, open the fridge, get the lettuce, put it on the stove, and win. So far, they've done the first four steps: opening the chest, taking the key, unlocking the door, and opening the door. Now they need to go east to the kitchen.

The next step mentioned in the task is after ensuring the door is open, go east. Since they just opened the door, the next logical step is to go east. The user's last action was opening the door, so the next command should be "go east" to proceed to the kitchen. Then they need to open the refrigerator, take the lettuce, and put it on the stove. The user is close, having completed most of the early steps. They just need to move to the kitchen next.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

A closed refrigerator is here. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. The counter is ordinary. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly infuriated by your TextWorld experience. You see a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You see a kitchen island. You see a note on the kitchen island, so there's that.

There is a closed screen door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. There is an unblocked exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
