Okay, the user is stuck in the bedroom. They've tried opening the chest drawer, getting the key, unlocking the door, but it's fixed. The trunk was empty, the bed didn't have anything, and the screen door isn't there. Maybe the key isn't the right one. Wait, the original goal mentioned the screen door. Maybe the user needs to open the screen door first. But the user can't see it. Alternatively, maybe the wooden door is locked with a different mechanism. The user might need to find another key. Since the trunk and bed didn't help, maybe the next step is to check the bed again. The bed is unstable, maybe there's something under it. The command could be "check bed" again. But the user already did that. Alternatively, maybe the user needs to look around the room again. The command could be "look around" or "examine room". But the game might not accept that. The user is out of options. Maybe the next step is to try using the key on the trunk. But the trunk is open and empty. I'm not sure. The user might have to give up and try something else. The next possible action is to try using the key again on the door, even though it's fixed. But the game says it's fixed. Maybe the user needs to find another way. The command could be "go east" but the door is closed. So the next action is to try using the key again on the door. But the game says it's fixed. Maybe the user is stuck and needs to try a different approach. The next command is "unlock wooden door".

Do you think you're making the right actions in the game so far? Do you think you're close to reaching the original goal?
Think about it, and then say your next action. Remember to only say the command and nothing else.
