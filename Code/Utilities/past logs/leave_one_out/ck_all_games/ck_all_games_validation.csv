-= Livingroom =-
You are in a livingroom. A standard one.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a sofa. The sofa is comfy. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a sofa in a room. Were you looking for an end table? Because look over there, it's an end table. You see a cushion on the end table. You can see a TV stand. You see a magazine on the TV stand. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things.
