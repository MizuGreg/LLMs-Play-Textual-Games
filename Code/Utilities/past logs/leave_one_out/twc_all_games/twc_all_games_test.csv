I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to go to the west. Following that, go south. And then, make an effort to venture south. Next, pick up the key from the floor of the garage. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Closet =-
Well, here we are in a closet.



You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Bar =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the bar. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.



There is an unguarded exit to the east. There is an unguarded exit to the south.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen. The room is well lit.

You make out a fridge. Hmmm... what else, what else? The fridge contains a diced fried red bell pepper, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a block of cheese. You make out a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. On the table you can see a cookbook. You make out a counter. You see a knife on the counter, so there's that. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.

You make out a fridge. Now why would someone leave that there? The fridge contains a block of cheese. Is this it? Is this what you came to TextWorld to see? a fridge? You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven! You make out a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You move on, clearly infuriated by your TextWorld experience. Oh, great. Here's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
Look at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.

Look over there! a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion and a white onion. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can make out a closed oven nearby. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.
