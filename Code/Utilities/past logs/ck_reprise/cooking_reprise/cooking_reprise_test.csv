You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A typical one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a raw white tuna, a white onion, a raw red tuna and an orange bell pepper. Oh, great. Here's an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a tomato, a raw yellow potato, a raw purple potato, a banana, a cookbook and a knife. You smell a pungent smell, and follow it to a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one. The room is well lit.

An open conventional looking fridge is right there by you. The fridge contains a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a red bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an oven. You make out a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you can make out a raw yellow potato, a yellow apple, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. This always happens!
