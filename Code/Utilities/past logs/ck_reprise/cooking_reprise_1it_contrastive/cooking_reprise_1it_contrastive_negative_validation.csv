You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place. The room is well lit.

You see a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a white onion, a raw white tuna and a red onion. Classic TextWorld. You can see an oven. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a tomato and a cookbook. You scan the room, seeing a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

You are in a kitchen. A typical one.

You can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a carrot. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a counter. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You can see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

You find yourself in a livingroom. A typical kind of place.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a sofa. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Bedroom =-
You're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a bedroom.

You see a bed. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a bed, go to TextWorld. The bed is large. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a sofa. The sofa is comfy. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An usual one.

You can see an opened conventional looking fridge in the room. The fridge contains a red bell pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a lettuce and a carrot. Hmm. You always thought you'd be more excited to see a fridge in a room. You see an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a yellow apple, a yellow onion, a red apple, a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open plain door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.
