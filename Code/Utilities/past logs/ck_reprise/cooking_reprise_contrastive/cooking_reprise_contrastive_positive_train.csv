You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You are in a kitchen. A standard one. The room is well lit.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The fridge contains a raw pork chop and a white onion. A closed conventional looking oven is here. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you can make out a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

You see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese and a raw pork chop. You smell a lovely smell, and follow it to an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out a counter. You see a tomato on the counter. Huh, weird. You see a stove. But the thing is empty.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

You make out an opened fridge, which looks conventional, in the room. The fridge contains a carrot, a yellow bell pepper, a yellow onion and a red hot pepper. You can make out an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. On the table you see a cookbook. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a raw red potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've just walked into a kitchen.

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a white onion, an orange bell pepper, a raw red tuna, a raw white tuna, a red onion, a lettuce and a yellow onion. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a closed oven here. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. On the table you see a cookbook. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a yellow apple, a raw purple potato, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a red apple and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

You're now in a livingroom. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You can see a sofa. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the south.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

You can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a raw red tuna, a raw red potato, a raw white tuna, a carrot and a lettuce. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You make out a closed oven. You can see a table. You see a cookbook on the table. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. You see a green apple, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the south.
