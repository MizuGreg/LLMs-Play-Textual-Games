You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You are in a kitchen. A standard one. The room is well lit.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The fridge contains a raw pork chop and a white onion. A closed conventional looking oven is here. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you can make out a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

You see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese and a raw pork chop. You smell a lovely smell, and follow it to an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out a counter. You see a tomato on the counter. Huh, weird. You see a stove. But the thing is empty.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

You make out an opened fridge, which looks conventional, in the room. The fridge contains a carrot, a yellow bell pepper, a yellow onion and a red hot pepper. You can make out an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. On the table you see a cookbook. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a raw red potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've just walked into a kitchen.

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a white onion, an orange bell pepper, a raw red tuna, a raw white tuna, a red onion, a lettuce and a yellow onion. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a closed oven here. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. On the table you see a cookbook. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a yellow apple, a raw purple potato, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a red apple and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

You've entered a kitchen.

An open fridge is here. The fridge contains a red bell pepper, a red apple and an orange bell pepper. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see an oven. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Classic TextWorld. You see a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open plain door leading west. There is an exit to the north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

You are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

You can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a raw red tuna, a raw red potato, a raw white tuna, a carrot and a lettuce. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You make out a closed oven. You can see a table. You see a cookbook on the table. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. You see a green apple, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the south.

Well, here we are in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

Oh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a raw white tuna. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can see an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. The table is massive. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You can see a counter. On the counter you make out a green hot pepper, a green apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An usual one. Let's see what's in here.

Oh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a red bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a raw white tuna and a white onion. Hey, want to see an oven? Look over there, an oven. Look over there! a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. The stove appears to be empty.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You're now in the kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a red bell pepper, a red onion, a carrot, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You make out an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You can see a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a yellow onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the south.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['chop', 'close', 'cook', 'dice', 'drink', 'drop', 'eat', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'prepare', 'put', 'slice', 'take', 'unlock'].

You're now in the kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can see an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a red bell pepper, a red onion, a carrot, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You make out an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You can see a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a yellow onion, a raw purple potato, a red apple, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the south.

Wow! You're in a kitchen.

You see an opened fridge, which looks conventional, nearby. The fridge contains a lettuce. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. Huh, weird. You see a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red apple, a raw red tuna and a yellow apple. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.
