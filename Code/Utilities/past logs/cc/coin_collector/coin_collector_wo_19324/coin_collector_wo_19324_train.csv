I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to move east. Okay, and then, recover the coin from the floor of the cookery. That's it!

-= Kitchenette =-
You are in a kitchenette. A typical kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.

This is going to sound unbelievable, but you've just entered a cookery. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First thing I need you to do is to make an effort to go to the east. Once you accomplish that, make an effort to take a trip east. After that, make an effort to move south. And then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the shower. And once you've done that, you win!
