I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to head north. And then, go west. If you can accomplish that, attempt to head west. Then, recover the coin from the floor of the kitchen. That's it!
