You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

You see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a lettuce, a green bell pepper, a green apple, a green hot pepper, a red bell pepper, a red onion and a block of cheese. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see an oven. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a banana and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?
