You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen. The room is well lit.

You make out a fridge. Hmmm... what else, what else? The fridge contains a diced fried red bell pepper, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a block of cheese. You make out a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. On the table you can see a cookbook. You make out a counter. You see a knife on the counter, so there's that. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.

You make out a fridge. Now why would someone leave that there? The fridge contains a block of cheese. Is this it? Is this what you came to TextWorld to see? a fridge? You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven! You make out a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You move on, clearly infuriated by your TextWorld experience. Oh, great. Here's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

Look at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.

Look over there! a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion and a white onion. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can make out a closed oven nearby. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.
