You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You've just walked into a kitchen.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge is empty, what a horrible day! You make out an oven. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a diced fried red potato, a red bell pepper and a raw yellow potato. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

Well, here we are in the kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call ""looking.""

You can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried egg. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to an oven. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook, so there's that. You see a counter. You see a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

You find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion. You see a closed oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a roasted yellow potato, a yellow onion, a raw purple potato and a green apple. You see a stove. The stove appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove! oh well.

You arrive in a normal kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.

You make out an opened fridge in the room. The fridge contains a roasted red tuna, a red onion and a raw white tuna. You see a closed oven. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

You are in a kitchen. A standard kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a carrot and a red bell pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. On the counter you can make out a roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a green apple, a tomato and a yellow apple. You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You make a grand eccentric entrance into a kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call ""looking.""

Were you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. Now why would someone leave that there? The fridge contains a fried red onion, a red hot pepper, a yellow onion and an orange bell pepper. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a closed oven. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook and a knife. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a stove. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.

You can see an opened fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out an oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. You see a fried green apple, a green hot pepper, a yellow apple and a knife on the counter. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

Well, here we are in the kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You see a fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You can see an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You smell a pungent smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. Huh, weird. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a roasted yellow potato, a yellow onion, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

You find yourself in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! What's that over there? It looks like it's an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a roasted red potato, a raw red tuna, a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a roasted white tuna, a white onion, a raw red tuna and a red bell pepper. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You can see a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a knife on the table. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw red potato and a cookbook. You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

This might come as a shock to you, but you've just come into a kitchen.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a fried red bell pepper, a raw red potato and a green hot pepper. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

Well, here we are in the kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion and a green bell pepper. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can see an oven. You can see a table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a table? You see a knife on the table. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. On the counter you can see a tomato, a red hot pepper, a green apple and a cookbook. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've just walked into a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You see a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. The fridge contains a sliced fried white onion, a raw white tuna, a yellow onion, a lettuce, a block of cheese and a green bell pepper. You look at the price tag that hangs off the fridge. Fifty bucks?! Where'd they buy this fridge, some kind of expensive store? You can see a closed oven in the room. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. You see a roasted green hot pepper, a green apple, a red bell pepper and a yellow apple on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a kitchen.

You can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains some milk. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You can see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. You see a chopped fried purple potato and a raw red potato on the counter, so there's that. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove! oh well.

You've entered a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can make out an opened fridge right there by you. The fridge contains a fried red tuna, a red hot pepper, a raw white tuna and a block of cheese. You make out a closed oven close by. You can make out a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Classic TextWorld. You can see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a chopped fried red potato, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

-= Kitchen =-
Well, here we are in the kitchen. The room is well lit.

Were you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. The fridge contains a chopped roasted yellow bell pepper, a diced roasted white tuna, a white onion, a raw red tuna, a yellow apple, a green bell pepper and a block of cheese. You can see an oven. An oven... Is that really what you were looking for? You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a banana. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.

You have stumbled into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a chopped carrot, a raw white tuna, a raw chicken breast and a parsley. You make out an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You see a counter. On the counter you make out a roasted banana, a red hot pepper and a cookbook. Wow! Just like in the movies! Oh, great. Here's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
Look at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal. You start to take note of what's in the room.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. The fridge contains a raw white tuna, a white onion and a raw red tuna. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a counter. On the counter you see a green apple, a green hot pepper, a yellow apple, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal one.

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a white onion, a red onion, a raw red potato, a yellow onion, a raw white tuna, a green bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can make out an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a green apple on the counter. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

You've just walked into a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see an opened fridge, which looks conventional, nearby. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a white onion, a raw white tuna, a red onion, a carrot, a raw red tuna, a green bell pepper and an orange bell pepper. You make out an oven. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you make out a banana and a knife. You can see a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one.

You make out a fridge. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The fridge contains a yellow onion, a yellow apple and a white onion. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a closed oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. You can make out a counter. You see a raw yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well
