You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You're now in a kitchen.

You can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a chopped roasted white onion, a raw white tuna, a red onion and a raw chicken wing. You can make out an oven. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You make out a table. On the table you make out a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a cookbook. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

You are in a kitchen. A normal one. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a chopped roasted yellow apple, a yellow onion and a red apple. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You've just shown up in a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a closed oven in the corner. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you can see a knife. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a fried yellow potato, a yellow apple, a raw red potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

You are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

You see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a roasted chicken breast, a raw chicken wing and a yellow bell pepper! You can see an oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

Okay, so you're in a kitchen, cool, but is it standard? You better believe it is.

You make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains a fried carrot. You can see an oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. The counter is vast. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You're now in the kitchen.

You make out a fridge, so there's that. The fridge contains a roasted white onion, a raw white tuna, a red onion, a raw chicken wing, a raw egg and a yellow bell pepper. You wonder idly who left that here. You make out an oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. The table is massive. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper, a red apple and a cookbook on the counter. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You see an opened fridge in the room. The fridge contains a red onion. You can make out a closed oven here. You can see a table. You see a cookbook on the table. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. On the counter you can see a fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a tomato. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

You find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see an opened fridge in the room. The fridge contains a diced fried carrot and a raw chicken wing. You can make out a closed oven in the room. You see a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.

An open fridge, which looks conventional, is close by. The fridge is empty, what a horrible day! You can see an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can see a diced roasted yellow apple, a yellow bell pepper, a red apple, a tomato, a raw red potato and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a closed oven. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You think about smashing the table to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a chopped roasted yellow potato, a yellow apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. You make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

You are in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.

You see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a roasted white tuna, a white onion, a raw red tuna and an orange bell pepper. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can make out an oven. You smell a fine smell, and follow it to a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You make out a fridge. The fridge contains a diced fried pork chop. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can make out an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You make out a counter. The counter is vast.

You've entered a kitchen.

You can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains some milk. You make out an oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook. You make out a stove. But the thing is empty.

You've just sauntered into a kitchen. The room is well lit.

You make out a fridge. Hmmm... what else, what else? The fridge contains a diced fried red bell pepper, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper and a block of cheese. You make out a closed oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. On the table you can see a cookbook. You make out a counter. You see a knife on the counter, so there's that. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've just shown up in a kitchen.

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a white onion. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You see a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a sliced fried purple potato and a raw yellow potato on the counter. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

Well, here we are in the kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call ""looking.""

You can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried egg. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to an oven. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook, so there's that. You see a counter. You see a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

You find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion. You see a closed oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a roasted yellow potato, a yellow onion, a raw purple potato and a green apple. You see a stove. The stove appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove! oh well.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a roasted pork chop. Classic TextWorld. You can see an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a counter. On the counter you make out a green hot pepper and a red hot pepper. You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove! The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You arrive in a normal kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.

You make out an opened fridge in the room. The fridge contains a roasted red tuna, a red onion and a raw white tuna. You see a closed oven. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

You make out a fridge. The fridge contains a fried block of cheese. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a counter in a room. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A standard kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge contains a carrot and a red bell pepper. You see a closed oven nearby. You can make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. On the counter you can make out a roasted red apple, a raw red potato, a green apple, a tomato and a yellow apple. You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.

-= Kitchen =-
Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a block of cheese. You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, here. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You smell a pungent smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried red potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato and a raw yellow potato. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You make a grand eccentric entrance into a kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call ""looking.""

Were you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. Now why would someone leave that there? The fridge contains a fried red onion, a red hot pepper, a yellow onion and an orange bell pepper. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a closed oven. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook and a knife. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a stove. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one. Let's see what's in here.

You can see an opened fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out an oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. You see a fried green apple, a green hot pepper, a yellow apple and a knife on the counter. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

Well, here we are in the kitchen. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You see a fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You can see an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You smell a pungent smell, and follow it to a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. Huh, weird. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a roasted yellow potato, a yellow onion, a raw purple potato and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

You see an opened fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You make out an oven. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red apple, a red onion, a yellow apple and a knife. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.

You find yourself in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! What's that over there? It looks like it's an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a roasted red potato, a raw red tuna, a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An usual kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a parsley. Oh, great. Here's an oven. You make out a table. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? You scan the room, seeing a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

You are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a roasted white tuna, a white onion, a raw red tuna and a red bell pepper. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You can see a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a knife on the table. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw red potato and a cookbook. You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

Of every kitchen you could have walked into, you had to walk into a normal one.

Oh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a roasted white tuna, a white onion, a raw red tuna, a block of cheese, a red bell pepper, an orange bell pepper and a cilantro. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. On the table you see a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. You see a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

Well, here we are in a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried red tuna, a red onion and a raw white tuna. A closed oven is nearby. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

On the counter you can see a fried red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a green bell pepper. Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. But the thing is empty. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
Well how about that, you are in the place we're calling the kitchen.

You can see a fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. You see a fried green hot pepper, a green apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a knife on the counter. You see a stove. The stove appears to be empty.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You are in a kitchen. A standard kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.

You scan the room for a fridge, and you find a fridge. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a red onion, a raw red tuna and a green bell pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a red bell pepper and a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

You are in a kitchen. A normal one.

You see an opened fridge right there by you. The fridge contains a red bell pepper. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. Wow! Just like in the movies! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a roasted tomato and a raw red potato. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've seen better kitchens, but at least this one seems pretty typical.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. The fridge contains a green bell pepper. Hey, want to see an oven? Look over there, an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. The table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a banana, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
Look at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.

You can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a raw red tuna, a red onion, a raw white tuna and a green bell pepper. You see an oven. Huh, weird. Oh, great. Here's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you see a red hot pepper. Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You move on, clearly furious with your TextWorld experience.

You find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.

You can make out a fridge. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The fridge contains a block of cheese. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven. You see a table! The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a counter. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You make out an opened fridge. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a closed oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You scan the room, seeing a counter. You see a red hot pepper, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.

You can make out an opened fridge here. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a red bell pepper, a lettuce and a raw pork chop. You see an oven. Classic TextWorld. You see a table. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a green apple, a tomato and a raw purple potato on the counter. You see a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You've just shown up in a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a white onion, a raw white tuna, a yellow onion and a green bell pepper. You see a closed oven. You see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook and a knife. Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.

Well, here we are in the kitchen. Let's see what's in here.

Look over there! a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can see an oven. You can make out a table. On the table you make out a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a yellow apple, a yellow onion, a red apple and a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.

You make out a fridge. You look at the price tag on the fridge. Sixty big ones?! Where'd they buy this fridge, some kind of expensive place? The fridge contains a yellow onion, a yellow apple and a red onion. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a closed oven right there by you. You can see a table. On the table you make out a knife. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

You arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You make out an oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a red bell pepper, a green hot pepper, a raw red potato and a raw purple potato. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A standard one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

An open conventional looking fridge is here. The fridge contains a white onion, a raw white tuna, a red onion and a carrot. You see a closed conventional looking oven right there by you. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. On the table you can make out a knife. Oh, great. Here's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a stove. The stove appears to be empty. This always happens!
