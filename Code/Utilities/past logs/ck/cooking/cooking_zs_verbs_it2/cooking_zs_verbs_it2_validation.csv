You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You're now in a kitchen.

You see a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a raw red tuna and a cilantro. Huh, weird. You make out a closed conventional looking oven nearby. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. There's something about an object in a room that's just so... TextWorld. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a chopped roasted tomato, a yellow apple and a cookbook. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You arrive in a kitchen. A typical one. You begin looking for stuff.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a fried green apple, a green bell pepper, a yellow apple and a cookbook on the counter. You see a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Hm. Oh well

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

You scan the room, seeing a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a raw white tuna and a red onion. You see an oven. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a fried green hot pepper, a green bell pepper, an orange bell pepper, a yellow apple, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

Well, here we are in a kitchen.

You can see a fridge. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The fridge is empty, what a horrible day! You can make out a closed oven. You make out a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a cookbook on the table. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a roasted red potato, a raw red tuna, a raw purple potato and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.

You make out a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see a closed oven. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. You see a raw red potato on the counter. Huh, weird. You make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
A rusty board tells you that you are now in the kitchen.

You can see an opened fridge in the room. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a green bell pepper, a yellow onion, an orange bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You can make out a closed oven nearby. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You make out a counter. You see a red hot pepper, a banana and a knife on the counter. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well
