To answer your question, this is a text-based adventure game, where I need to navigate through a virtual world by entering commands or actions in the form of a sentence surrounded by double quotes.

For example, a valid action could be:

""take coin""

Or:

""go north""

Or:

""examine bed""

And so on. The goal of this game is to collect the coin on the floor and exit the room.

Welcome to Coin Collector, a textual adventure game where you'll explore rooms, interact with objects, and collect coins. Your goal is to make your way through the building, pick up as many coins as possible, and eventually reach the treasure room.

You are currently in the lobby of the TextWorld mansion. You have just entered the building and are ready to start your adventure.

The setting: The lobby is a grand entrance with high ceilings, marble floors, and ornate chandeliers. There's a large wooden door to the west that looks like it hasn't been used in ages. To the east lies a corridor leading deeper into the mansion.

Your task for today:

1. Head west.
2. Next, travel west.
3. And then, go west.
4. Pick up the coin from the floor of the study.

Welcome to TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, travel west. That done, try to travel north. Following that, venture west. If you can succeed at that, head west. Then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the washroom. Got that? Good!

-= Sauna =-
Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a sauna. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.
