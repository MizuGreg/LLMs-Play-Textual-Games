It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is how to play! Your first objective is to attempt to move north. Following that, pick up the coin from the floor of the cookery. Alright, thanks!

-= Playroom =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just come into a playroom. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?



You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is unguarded.

-= Cookery =-
You've entered an ordinary room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be ordinary. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the cookery. The room is well lit.



There is an unblocked exit to the south.

There is a coin on the floor.

Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. Your first objective is to make an attempt to venture south. Then, make an effort to venture south. After that, lift the coin from the floor of the playroom. Got that? Good!

-= Basement =-
You've just sauntered into a basement. You start to take note of what's in the room.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, it is unguarded.

Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, go west. After that, make an effort to travel north. And then, make an attempt to venture east. After that, go east. With that done, retrieve the coin from the floor of the workshop. Alright, thanks!

Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to go to the north. Then, attempt to go to the north. That done, venture east. And then, go to the south. And then, lift the coin from the floor of the dish-pit. Got that? Good!

Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First off, attempt to move west. Okay, and then, travel south. Following that, make an attempt to head east. After that, go east. With that accomplished, lift the coin from the floor of the canteen. And if you do that, you're the winner!

-= Kitchenette =-
I am excited to announce that you are now in the kitchenette. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going west.

Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, make an attempt to venture south. With that accomplished, attempt to move south. And then, attempt to venture west. Once you manage that, attempt to move west. Then, make an effort to move west. Once you succeed at that, retrieve the coin from the floor of the steam room. And once you've done that, you win!

Then, pick up the coin from the floor of the vault. That's it!
