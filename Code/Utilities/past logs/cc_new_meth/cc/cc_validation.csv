Welcome to another life changing round of TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, make an effort to move north. And then, take a trip west. With that accomplished, venture west. Following that, retrieve the coin from the floor of the bedroom. Alright, thanks!

-= Kitchenette =-
You find yourself in a kitchenette.



There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
