You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A typical one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can make out an opened fridge close by. The fridge contains a red onion and a yellow bell pepper. You make out a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a yellow apple and a knife. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You are in a kitchen. A typical one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You make out a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a red bell pepper and a white onion. Classic TextWorld. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can see a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You can see a fridge. The fridge contains a red bell pepper, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper and a raw red tuna. Look over there! an oven. Huh, weird. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a yellow apple and a raw purple potato, so there's that. You make out a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

You've just walked into a kitchen.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The fridge contains a raw white tuna. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an oven. You can see a table! The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a green apple, a red hot pepper, a green bell pepper, a red apple, a red bell pepper, a raw red potato, a green hot pepper, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

You find yourself in a kitchen.

You can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a raw white tuna, an orange bell pepper, a green bell pepper, a white onion, a raw red tuna, a lettuce and a red onion. You see a closed oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a counter.

You are in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a yellow onion, a red bell pepper, a raw red tuna, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion and a raw white tuna. You see a closed oven in the corner. You can see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Oh, great. Here's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a green apple, a green hot pepper, a banana, a cookbook and a knife, so there's that. You can see a stove! The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You arrive in a kitchen. An usual one. Let's see what's in here.

You can see an opened fridge right there by you. The fridge contains a yellow onion, a red onion, a raw red tuna, a raw yellow potato, a white onion, a raw pork chop, a lettuce, a carrot and an orange bell pepper. What's that over there? It looks like it's an oven. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a green hot pepper, a tomato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You find yourself in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.

You can make out a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a white onion, a raw white tuna, a yellow onion, a raw red tuna and a yellow bell pepper. A closed oven is close by. You see a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

Well, here we are in a kitchen.

You can make out a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a white onion, a raw white tuna, a yellow onion and a red onion. A closed oven is here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. On the table you make out a knife. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a green hot pepper, a green bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a tomato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a red bell pepper, a raw red potato, a green bell pepper and a raw red tuna. You make out a closed conventional looking oven nearby. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. You see a yellow apple, a green hot pepper, a green apple, a red hot pepper, a yellow onion and a red apple on the counter, so there's that. You see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best?

This might come as a shock to you, but you've just come into a kitchen.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The fridge contains a red bell pepper, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a red hot pepper and a green bell pepper. You make out a closed oven close by. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a counter. You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a yellow onion, a raw red potato, a green apple, a yellow apple and a cookbook on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

You are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. Let's see what's in here.

You make out an opened fridge in the corner. The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a raw white tuna, a white onion, a yellow onion, a raw red tuna, a lettuce, a red onion, a green apple, a red hot pepper and a block of cheese. Now why would someone leave that there? You see an oven. You can see a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a green hot pepper, a red apple, a tomato, a raw yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow apple, a banana and a knife. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

You are in a kitchen. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

Were you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! The fridge contains a red bell pepper, a red onion and a raw pork chop. You see a closed oven here. You make out a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter! You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.

There is an open plain door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You've just walked into a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a white onion, a raw white tuna, a yellow onion, a lettuce, an orange bell pepper and a red onion. Oh, great. Here's an oven. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You can see a counter. You see a red apple, a raw red potato and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

You're now in a bathroom. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call ""looking.""

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a toilet. The toilet is white. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just walked into a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a raw pork chop. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You see a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw red tuna, a yellow apple, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a knife. You make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst.

There is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the west.

You are in a kitchen. An usual kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

Were you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. Huh, weird. The fridge contains a block of cheese and a lettuce. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can see a knife. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw red potato, a red bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a tomato and a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You smell a fine smell, and follow it to a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open frosted-glass door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.
