Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen.

You can see an opened conventional looking fridge in the room. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a yellow apple, an orange bell pepper and a carrot. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see an oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You scan the room, seeing a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

You're now in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a red bell pepper and a white onion, so there's that. You see an oven. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a banana, a green apple and a cookbook. Classic TextWorld. You smell a fine smell, and follow it to a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

I am honoured to announce that you are now in the kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call ""looking.""

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a block of cheese, a yellow onion and a green bell pepper. You can see an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. On the table you can make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. On the counter you make out a cookbook. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a raw red tuna, a green apple, an orange bell pepper, a red apple, a raw white tuna and a red bell pepper. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. A closed oven is in the corner. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you see a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a red hot pepper, a tomato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a green hot pepper and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a green bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a raw pork chop. You can see a closed oven in the corner. You see a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you make out a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a green hot pepper and a knife. Look over there! a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?



these are the possible verbs that you can use:'take', 'open', 'examine', 'chop', 'cook', 'turn', 'wait', 'slice', 'dice', 'eat', 'check', 'look', 'close', 'read', 'get', 're', 'search', 'go'. Use just one verb per action.

You've entered a kitchen.

You make out an opened fridge, which looks conventional, right there by you. The fridge contains a carrot, a raw white tuna, a lettuce and an orange bell pepper. You can make out an oven. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You scan the room, seeing a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a knife on the table. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. You see a raw yellow potato, a yellow onion, a raw red potato and a cookbook on the counter. You make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

You've entered a kitchen.

You can make out a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw white tuna and an orange bell pepper. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh, great. Here's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
