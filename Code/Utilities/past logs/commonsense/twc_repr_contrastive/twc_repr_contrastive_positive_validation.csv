Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Pantry =-
This is going to sound unbelievable, but you've just entered a pantry. Let's see what's in here.

You make out a shelf. Now why would someone leave that there? However, the shelf, like an empty shelf, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the shelf! oh well. You can make out a folding chair. The folding chair is wooden. On the folding chair you can see a white onion.
