You're now in the backyard. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a clothesline. But the thing is empty. Hey, want to see a patio chair? Look over there, a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. On the patio chair you make out a wet jacket.

This is going to sound unbelievable, but you've just entered a pantry. Let's see what's in here.

You make out a shelf. Now why would someone leave that there? However, the shelf, like an empty shelf, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the shelf! oh well. You can make out a folding chair. The folding chair is wooden. On the folding chair you can see a red onion.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. An usual one. You can barely contain your excitement.

You see a BBQ. You see a wet hawaiian shirt on the BBQ. You make out a clothesline. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a workbench. The workbench is wooden. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. An ordinary one. Let's see what's in here.

You see a wardrobe. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. The wardrobe is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a nightstand. The nightstand is typical. On the nightstand you make out a gray blanket. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best?

This might come as a shock to you, but you've just moved into a bedroom.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a wardrobe. The wardrobe is empty! What a waste of a day! You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Were you looking for a desk? Because look over there, it's a desk. On the desk you can see a white belt.

You've entered a pantry. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a shelf. You wonder idly who left that here. The shelf is wooden. The shelf appears to be empty. You see a folding chair. The folding chair is wooden. On the folding chair you see some sugar. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things.

Oh, great. Here's a sofa. You see a newspaper on the sofa. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an end table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a side table. The side table is wooden, small. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. This always happens!

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Backyard =-
You are in a backyard. It seems to be pretty usual here. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can make out a BBQ. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a clothesline. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a clothesline? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a workbench. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.



There is a wet red T-shirt on the floor.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

This might come as a shock to you, but you've just come into a bedroom. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can make out a wardrobe. What a letdown! The wardrobe is empty! You can make out a bed. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh, great. Here's a nightstand. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a white blanket on the nightstand.

-= Pantry =-
Well, here we are in the pantry.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a shelf. But the thing is empty. You smell a lovely smell, and follow it to a folding chair. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a folding chair? The folding chair is wooden. On the folding chair you can make out a red onion.

-= Livingroom =-
You arrive in a livingroom. A typical kind of place.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a wastepaper basket. The wastepaper basket is empty, what a horrible day! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a sofa. The sofa is comfy. On the sofa you make out a table lamp. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an end table. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? The end table is wooden. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.



There is a notebook on the floor.

-= Backyard =-
You've just sauntered into a backyard. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You scan the room, seeing a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. On the BBQ you see a wet plaid blazer. You can make out a clothesline. The clothesline is standard. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a workbench. On the workbench you make out a pair of wet cargo pants.

-= Pantry =-
You find yourself in a standard kind of place. That is to say, you're in a pantry. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You make out a shelf. The shelf is wooden. However, the shelf, like an empty shelf, has nothing on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a folding chair. The folding chair is wooden. On the folding chair you see some black pepper and some olive oil.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. On the BBQ you can make out a wet checkered jumper. You see a clothesline. The clothesline is ordinary. However, the clothesline, like an empty clothesline, has nothing on it. What's that over there? It looks like it's a workbench. On the workbench you can see a pair of wet gray panties.



There is a wet brown jumper on the floor.

-= Livingroom =-

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical one.

You see a wardrobe. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You scan the room, seeing a bed. The bed is large. On the bed you see a clean plaid blazer. You can make out a dressing table. The dressing table is usual. On the dressing table you see a brown tie!

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Livingroom =-
You are in a livingroom. An ordinary kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You make out an opened wastepaper basket right there by you. The wastepaper basket is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a sofa. The sofa is comfy. The sofa appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an end table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can see an armchair. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? The armchair is comfortable. On the armchair you can make out a clean maroon skirt. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this!

You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

You find yourself in a backyard. A normal one.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a BBQ. On the BBQ you can make out a scarf. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a clothesline. On the clothesline you see a wet cardigan and a wet white pullover. You can see a workbench. The workbench appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well Oh, great. Here's a patio chair. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open sliding patio door leading north.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Laundry Room =-
You arrive in a laundry room. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

Look over there! a washing machine. The washing machine is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a laundry basket. The laundry basket is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever!

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is an umbrella on the floor.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Corridor =-
You're now in a corridor.

You scan the room, seeing an umbrella stand. The umbrella stand is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

There is a dirty brown T-shirt and a dirty white shirt on the floor.
