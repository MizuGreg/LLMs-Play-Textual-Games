Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Livingroom =-
You find yourself in a livingroom. A normal one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You scan the room for a sofa, and you find a sofa. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a newspaper on the sofa. You see an end table. However, the end table, like an empty end table, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see an end table in a room. You make out a TV stand. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. An ordinary kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a clothesline. But there isn't a thing on it. You scan the room for a patio table, and you find a patio table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a patio table, go to TextWorld. On the patio table you make out a wet white bra.



There is a pair of wet gray knickers on the floor.
