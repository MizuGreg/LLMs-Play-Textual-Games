Oh, great. Here's a shelf. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a shelf? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience! You scan the room for a folding chair, and you find a folding chair. The folding chair is wooden. On the folding chair you make out some salt.

-= Laundry Room =-
You are in a laundry room. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a washing machine. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The washing machine is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out an opened laundry basket. The laundry basket is empty, what a horrible day!



There is a dirty azure skirt and a dirty white blazer on the floor.

-= Backyard =-
You've entered a backyard.

You can see a BBQ. You wonder idly who left that here. On the BBQ you can see a wet gray blazer. You scan the room, seeing a clothesline. The clothesline is standard. The clothesline appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a workbench. You see a pair of wet black underpants and a wet maroon dress on the workbench.

You've entered a kitchen.

You see an opened fridge nearby. The fridge contains some salt. You see a kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard is empty! What a waste of a day! You can see an opened dishwasher, which looks normal, in the corner. The dishwasher contains a clean glass. You scan the room, seeing a dining table. The dining table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a ladderback chair. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a ladderback chair? The ladderback chair is solid. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open plain door leading west.
