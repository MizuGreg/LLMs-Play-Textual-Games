-= Bedroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom.

You make out an opened wardrobe. What a letdown! The wardrobe is empty! You make out a bed. The bed is large. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well You make out a dressing table. The dressing table is standard. On the dressing table you can make out a raincoat.



There is a plaid tie on the floor.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. An ordinary one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call ""looking.""

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a wardrobe. The wardrobe is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You can make out a dressing table. The dressing table is standard. On the dressing table you can see a clean white jumper.



these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a shoe cabinet. You shudder, but continue examining the room. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this?
