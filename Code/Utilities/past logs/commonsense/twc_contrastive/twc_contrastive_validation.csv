Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Livingroom =-
You are in a livingroom. A typical one.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a wastepaper basket. The wastepaper basket is empty, what a horrible day! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a sofa. The sofa is comfy. The sofa appears to be empty. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an end table. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? The end table is wooden. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.



There is a magazine and an used tissue on the floor.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

You are in a laundry room. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a washing machine. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The washing machine is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out an opened laundry basket. The laundry basket is empty, what a horrible day!



There is a dirty tank top and a dirty brown skirt on the floor.

-= Pantry =-
This is going to sound unbelievable, but you've just entered a pantry. Let's see what's in here.

You make out a shelf. Now why would someone leave that there? However, the shelf, like an empty shelf, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the shelf! oh well. You can make out a folding chair. The folding chair is wooden. On the folding chair you can see a white onion.

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. An ordinary kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out a BBQ. On the BBQ you can see a wet jacket. You scan the room for a clothesline, and you find a clothesline. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio chair. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens!



There is a wet black T-shirt on the floor.
