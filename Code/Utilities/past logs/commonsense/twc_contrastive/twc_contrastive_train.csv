Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Livingroom =-
Ah, the livingroom. This is some kind of livingroom, really great usual vibes in this place, a wonderful usual atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see a sofa. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the sofa! oh well. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an end table. You shudder, but continue examining the end table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see an armchair. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Backyard =-
You've just sauntered into a backyard. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You scan the room, seeing a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. On the BBQ you see a wet green dress. You can make out a clothesline. The clothesline is standard. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a workbench. On the workbench you make out a wet blue bra.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Backyard =-
You're now in a backyard.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a BBQ. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a BBQ, go to TextWorld. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hey, want to see a clothesline? Look over there, a clothesline. But the thing is empty. You make out a patio chair. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. An ordinary one. Let's see what's in here.

You see a wardrobe. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. The wardrobe is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a bed. The bed is large. On the bed you can see a clean blue dress. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a nightstand. The nightstand is typical. The nightstand appears to be empty.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Livingroom =-
You find yourself in a livingroom. A normal one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You scan the room for a sofa, and you find a sofa. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see an end table. You see a cushion on the end table. You make out a TV stand. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You've just walked into a livingroom.

You can make out a sofa. On the sofa you make out a copybook. You make out an end table. The end table is wooden. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a grey carpet. The grey carpet is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Pantry =-
Well, here we are in the pantry.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a shelf. But the thing is empty. You smell a lovely smell, and follow it to a folding chair. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a folding chair? The folding chair is wooden. On the folding chair you can make out a red onion.

-= Bedroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom.

You can see an opened wardrobe close by. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a bed. The bed is large. On the bed you make out a raincoat. You can make out a nightstand. Now why would someone leave that there? The nightstand is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Hm. Oh well

This might come as a shock to you, but you've just come into a bedroom. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can make out a wardrobe. What a letdown! The wardrobe is empty! You can make out a bed. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh, great. Here's a nightstand. Now why would someone leave that there? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You move on, clearly done caring about TextWorld.

-= Backyard =-
You are in a backyard. An usual one. You can barely contain your excitement.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a BBQ. On the BBQ you can see a wet checkered T-shirt. You can see a clothesline. However, the clothesline, like an empty clothesline, has nothing on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a patio table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Livingroom =-
You are in a livingroom. A typical one.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a wastepaper basket. The wastepaper basket is empty, what a horrible day! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a sofa. The sofa is comfy. The sofa appears to be empty. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an end table. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? The end table is wooden. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.



There is a magazine and an used tissue on the floor.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Backyard =-
You arrive in a backyard. An ordinary kind of place.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a clothesline. But there isn't a thing on it. You scan the room for a patio table, and you find a patio table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a patio table, go to TextWorld. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a washing machine. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The washing machine is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out an opened laundry basket. The laundry basket is empty, what a horrible day!



There is a dirty tank top and a dirty brown skirt on the floor.

-= Corridor =-
You have fallen into a corridor. Not the corridor you'd expect. No, this is a corridor. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

Oh, great. Here's an umbrella stand. The umbrella stand appears to be empty. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a coat hanger. But the thing is empty.



There is an umbrella, a scarf and a gray coat on the floor.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Pantry =-
You find yourself in a standard kind of place. That is to say, you're in a pantry. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You make out a shelf. The shelf is wooden. However, the shelf, like an empty shelf, has nothing on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a folding chair. The folding chair is wooden. On the folding chair you see a yellow onion and a red onion.

You've fallen into a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the laundry room. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can make out an opened standard looking washing machine close by. The washing machine is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out an opened laundry basket nearby. The laundry basket is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever!

You make out a shelf. Now why would someone leave that there? However, the shelf, like an empty shelf, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the shelf! oh well. You can make out a folding chair. The folding chair is wooden. On the folding chair you can see a white onion.

You make out a fridge, so there's that. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! Were you looking for a kitchen cupboard? Because look over there, it's a kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard is empty, what a horrible day! You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a trash can, so there's that. The trash can is empty, what a horrible day! You can make out a dining table. You see a clean colander on the dining table.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Backyard =-
You're now in the backyard.

You can make out a BBQ. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a clothesline. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a clothesline? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a workbench. On the workbench you see a pair of wet black socks.

-= Livingroom =-
You arrive in a livingroom. A standard one.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a wastepaper basket. The wastepaper basket is empty, what a horrible day! You can make out a sofa. You see a magazine on the sofa. You see an end table. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the end table.

You've entered a livingroom.

You can make out a sofa. The sofa is comfy. However, the sofa, like an empty sofa, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the sofa. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an end table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You make out a coffee table. The coffee table is small. On the coffee table you see a cushion.
