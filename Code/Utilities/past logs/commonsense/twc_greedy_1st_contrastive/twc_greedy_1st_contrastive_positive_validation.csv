Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Pantry =-
You're now in a pantry.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a shelf. You see a dirty roasting tray on the shelf. You see a folding chair. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an open plain door leading east.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You see a fridge, so there's that. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You scan the room, seeing a kitchen cupboard. What a letdown! The kitchen cupboard is empty! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a dishwasher. Classic TextWorld. The dishwasher is empty, what a horrible day! You can see a dining table. The dining table is massive. On the dining table you see a dirty spoon.

There is an open plain door leading west.
