Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Backyard =-
You're now in the backyard. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a clothesline. But the thing is empty. Hey, want to see a patio chair? Look over there, a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. On the patio chair you make out a wet jacket.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can see an opened fridge nearby. The fridge contains some sugar! You make out an opened kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard is empty, what a horrible day! You can make out a dining table! The dining table is massive. On the dining table you see a clean roasting tray. Oh, great. Here's a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. What's the point of an empty counter?

I just think it's great that you've just entered a kitchen.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? An open kitchen cupboard is here. The kitchen cupboard contains a white tuna. You make out a dining table. The dining table is massive. On the dining table you can see a potato peeler. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.

You find yourself in a pantry. An ordinary kind of place. Let's see what's in here.

You make out a shelf. But there isn't a thing on it. You scan the room for a folding chair, and you find a folding chair. You see a yellow onion, a red hot pepper and some black pepper on the folding chair. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Pantry =-
You arrive in a pantry. Let's see what's in here.

Were you looking for a shelf? Because look over there, it's a shelf. The shelf is wooden. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a folding chair. On the folding chair you make out a green hot pepper, a red hot pepper and some peanut oil. Wow! Just like in the movies!

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Bathroom =-
Of every bathroom you could have walked into, you had to saunter into a typical one.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a shower. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a toilet. The toilet is white. On the toilet you can make out some shampoo. You see a sink. The sink is ordinary. However, the sink, like an empty sink, has nothing on it. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a towel rail. However, the towel rail, like an empty towel rail, has nothing on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

There is a towel on the floor.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Corridor =-
You arrive in a corridor. An usual kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.

You see an umbrella stand. The umbrella stand is normal. However, the umbrella stand, like an empty umbrella stand, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is an umbrella on the floor.

-= Backyard =-
You've just walked into a backyard.

You can see a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. On the BBQ you see a pair of wet black panties. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a clothesline. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Silly clothesline, silly, empty, good for nothing clothesline. You see a patio chair. On the patio chair you see a wet blue pullover.

There is an open patio door leading west.

There is a wet orange dress on the floor.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a key holder. The key holder is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open patio door leading east.

There is an open patio door leading north.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an umbrella stand. The umbrella stand is normal. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the south.

There is a dirty brown skirt on the floor.

You are in a laundry room. An ordinary one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out a washing machine. What a letdown! The washing machine is empty! You see a laundry basket. Hmmm... what else, what else? The laundry basket contains a dirty checkered pullover.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

There is an umbrella on the floor.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You can make out an opened kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard is empty, what a horrible day! An open oven is close by. What a letdown! The oven is empty! You scan the room for a dining table, and you find a dining table. The dining table is massive.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Backyard =-
Ah, the backyard. This is some kind of backyard, really great typical vibes in this place, a wonderful typical atmosphere.

You make out a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. But there isn't a thing on it. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a clothesline. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a clothesline? However, the clothesline, like an empty clothesline, has nothing on it. You make out a workbench. The workbench is wooden. On the workbench you can see a wet sweater.

You can make out a BBQ. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a clothesline. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a clothesline? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a workbench.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. An ordinary one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call ""looking.""

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a wardrobe. The wardrobe is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You can make out a dressing table. The dressing table is standard. On the dressing table you can see a clean singlet.



these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

You've just walked into a livingroom.

You can make out a sofa. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out an end table. The end table is wooden. On the end table you make out a cushion. You make out a grey carpet. The grey carpet is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. An ordinary kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a clothesline. But there isn't a thing on it. You scan the room for a patio table, and you find a patio table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a patio table, go to TextWorld. On the patio table you make out a wet white bra.



There is a pair of wet gray knickers on the floor.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom.

You make out an opened wardrobe. What a letdown! The wardrobe is empty! You make out a bed. The bed is large. On the bed you can see a blue coat and a clean brown pullover. You make out a dressing table. The dressing table is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

-= Livingroom =-
You are in a livingroom. It seems to be pretty typical here. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can make out a sofa. You shudder, but continue examining the sofa. The sofa is comfy. The sofa appears to be empty. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. On the end table you make out a cushion. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an armchair. On the armchair you make out a vase and a picture.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Backyard =-
You have stumbled into a backyard. Not the backyard you'd expect. No, this is a backyard. The room is well lit.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. On the BBQ you can make out a wet checkered jumper. You see a clothesline. The clothesline is ordinary. However, the clothesline, like an empty clothesline, has nothing on it. What's that over there? It looks like it's a workbench. On the workbench you can see a pair of wet gray panties.



There is a wet brown jumper on the floor.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Corridor =-
Well, here we are in a corridor.

You make out an umbrella stand. However, the umbrella stand, like an empty umbrella stand, has nothing on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

There is some handsoap on the floor.

-= Bathroom =-
You've entered a bathroom. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call ""looking.""

You can see a shower. The shower is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can make out a toilet. The toilet is white. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can make out a sink. The sink is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a toilet roll holder. The toilet roll holder is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a dressing table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a dressing table? The dressing table is usual. However, the dressing table, like an empty dressing table, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

There is some toilet paper on the floor.

-= Bathroom =-
You've entered a bathroom. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call ""looking.""

You can see a shower. The shower is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can make out a toilet. The toilet is white. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can make out a sink. The sink is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a toilet roll holder. The toilet roll holder is ordinary. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a dressing table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a dressing table? The dressing table is usual. However, the dressing table, like an empty dressing table, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

There is some toilet paper on the floor.

-= Corridor =-
Well, here we are in a corridor.

You make out an umbrella stand. However, the umbrella stand, like an empty umbrella stand, has nothing on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

There is some handsoap on the floor.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Pantry =-
You have fallen into the most ordinary of all possible pantrys. You can barely contain your excitement.

Look over there! a shelf. The shelf is wooden. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a folding chair. On the folding chair you make out a mixer and a clean pan.

There is an open plain door leading south.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A normal one.

You see a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You make out an opened kitchen cupboard nearby. What a letdown! The kitchen cupboard is empty! Hey, want to see a dining table? Look over there, a dining table. The dining table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a ladderback chair! The ladderback chair is solid. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an open plain door leading north.

Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a laundry room.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a washing machine. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The washing machine is empty, what a horrible day! You can make out a work table. You see a pair of dirty jeans on the work table. Huh, weird.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

There is a pair of dirty white panties on the floor.

-= Corridor =-
You find yourself in a corridor. A typical kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a key holder. The key holder is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is a key on the floor.

Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a laundry room.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a washing machine. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The washing machine is empty, what a horrible day! You can make out a work table. You see a pair of dirty jeans on the work table. Huh, weird.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Bathroom =-
Well, here we are in a bathroom.

Look over there! a shower. The shower is empty, what a horrible day! You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a toilet. The toilet is white. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a sink. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a sink? The sink is ordinary. On the sink you can make out a dirty brown bra. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can see a dressing table. But the thing is empty.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Laundry Room =-
You arrive in a laundry room. A typical one.

Oh, great. Here's a washing machine. What a letdown! The washing machine is empty! You see an opened clothes drier, which looks standard, in the corner. The clothes drier is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can make out a work table. You see a wet gray jumper on the work table.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

There is a wet cardigan on the floor.

You see a shelf. On the shelf you can see a kettle. You make out a folding chair. The folding chair is wooden. The folding chair appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an open plain door leading east.
