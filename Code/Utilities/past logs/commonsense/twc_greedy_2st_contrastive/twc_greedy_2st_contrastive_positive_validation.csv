Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Livingroom =-
You arrive in a livingroom. A typical one.

You can see an opened bookcase. The bookcase contains a vase. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! Look over there! a sofa. The sofa appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You scan the room, seeing an end table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.



these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Pantry =-
You've entered a pantry. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a shelf. You wonder idly who left that here. The shelf is wooden. The shelf appears to be empty. You see a folding chair. The folding chair is wooden. On the folding chair you see some sugar. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things.
