Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Livingroom =-
You've just walked into a livingroom.

You can make out a sofa. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out an end table. The end table is wooden. On the end table you make out a cushion. You make out a grey carpet. The grey carpet is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.
