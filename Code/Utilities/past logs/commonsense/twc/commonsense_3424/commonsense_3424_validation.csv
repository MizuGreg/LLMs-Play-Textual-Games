Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Pantry =-
You are in a pantry. It seems to be pretty standard here.

You make out a shelf. The shelf is wooden. However, the shelf, like an empty shelf, has nothing on it. You can make out a folding chair. Now why would someone leave that there? On the folding chair you make out a spice container.

-= Livingroom =-
You're now in a livingroom. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You can make out a sofa. The sofa is comfy. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You make out an end table. On the end table you see a cushion. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a grey carpet. The grey carpet is ordinary. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

-= Backyard =-
Well, here we are in a backyard. You begin looking for stuff.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. On the BBQ you make out a wet yellow dress. What's that over there? It looks like it's a clothesline. The clothesline appears to be empty. You make out a patio table. You shudder, but continue examining the patio table. The patio table is stylish. On the patio table you make out a wet striped pullover.



There is a wet plaid jumper on the floor.
