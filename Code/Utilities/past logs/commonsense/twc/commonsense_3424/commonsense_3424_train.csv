Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. A typical one.

You make out a BBQ. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a clothesline. The clothesline is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the clothesline. You can make out a patio table. Now why would someone leave that there? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.



There is a wet blue polo shirt on the floor.

You arrive in a backyard. A normal one.

You can see a BBQ. You see a wet black blazer on the BBQ. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a clothesline. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can see a workbench. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the workbench.

-= Backyard =-
You are in a backyard. An ordinary kind of place. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

Look over there! a BBQ. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. You can see a clothesline. The clothesline is typical. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You see a workbench. You see a wet blue skirt on the workbench.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Livingroom =-
You arrive in a livingroom. A typical one.

You make out an opened wastepaper basket. What a letdown! The wastepaper basket is empty! You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a sofa. You see a magazine on the sofa. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an end table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

-= Backyard =-
You've just shown up in a backyard. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call ""looking.""

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a clothesline. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! However, the clothesline, like an empty clothesline, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the clothesline to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on. You can make out a patio chair. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The patio chair is stylish. On the patio chair you see a wet jacket.

-= Pantry =-
I am excited to announce that you are now in the pantry. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You see a shelf. The shelf is wooden. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You see a folding chair. The folding chair is wooden. On the folding chair you see a yellow onion.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a washing machine. You wonder idly who left that here. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can see an opened laundry basket, which looks typical, in the corner. The laundry basket is empty! What a waste of a day!

-= Backyard =-
You've entered a backyard.

You make out a BBQ. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Silly BBQ, silly, empty, good for nothing BBQ. You can make out a clothesline. The clothesline is typical. However, the clothesline, like an empty clothesline, has nothing on it. You make out a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. On the patio chair you can make out a wet black T-shirt. Hmmm... what else, what else?



There is a wet striped blazer on the floor.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

You are in a livingroom. A normal one.

You can make out a bookcase. The bookcase is empty! What a waste of a day! Hey, want to see a sofa? Look over there, a sofa. The sofa is comfy. The sofa appears to be empty. You can see an end table. The end table is wooden. However, the end table, like an empty end table, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the end table to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.



There is a cushion on the floor.

-= Backyard =-
You've seen better backyards, but at least this one seems pretty standard.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. On the BBQ you can see a wet maroon dress. You make out a clothesline. The clothesline is usual. However, the clothesline, like an empty clothesline, has nothing on it. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You can see a patio chair.

-= Backyard =-
You arrive in a backyard. A normal one.

You make out a BBQ. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a clothesline. The clothesline is typical. But the thing is empty. You can make out a patio table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! You see a wet orange dress on the patio table. Hmmm... what else, what else?

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A standard one.

Oh, great. Here's a fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You make out a kitchen cupboard. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a trash can. The trash can is empty, what a horrible day! You make out a dining table. You see a clean pan on the dining table. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now.

-= Pantry =-
Well I'll be, you are in the place we're calling the pantry. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a shelf. You wonder idly who left that here. The shelf is wooden. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can make out a folding chair. The folding chair is wooden. On the folding chair you make out some peanut oil. Classic TextWorld.

Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a corridor.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a key holder. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

-= Backyard =-
Well, here we are in a backyard.

You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You can see a clothesline. The clothesline is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh, great. Here's a workbench. You see a wet blue T-shirt on the workbench.

-= Pantry =-
This is going to sound unbelievable, but you've just entered a pantry. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You see a shelf. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! What's that over there? It looks like it's a folding chair. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a folding chair? The folding chair is wooden. On the folding chair you can see a spice container.

-= Corridor =-
Look at you, bigshot, walking into a corridor like it isn't some huge deal. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a hat rack. The hat rack is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well



There is a straw hat on the floor.

You've entered a livingroom.

You scan the room for a sofa, and you find a sofa. The sofa is comfy. The sofa appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out an end table. The end table is wooden. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a side table. The side table is wooden, small. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the side table.



There is a pen on the floor.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Pantry =-
You find yourself in a pantry.

You scan the room, seeing a shelf. The shelf is wooden. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What's the point of an empty shelf? You make out a folding chair. On the folding chair you can make out a green hot pepper. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.



these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

You are in a bedroom. An usual kind of place.

You make out an opened large looking wardrobe right there by you. What a letdown! The wardrobe is empty! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a desk chair. On the desk chair you see a clean brown shirt.

You've just shown up in a backyard. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You see a BBQ. On the BBQ you see a wet white skirt. What's that over there? It looks like it's a clothesline. The clothesline is ordinary. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You make out a patio chair. But the thing is empty.

You are in a corridor. A typical kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a shoe cabinet. The shoe cabinet is empty! What a waste of a day!



There is a pair of blue sneakers on the floor.

You're now in the livingroom.

You make out a bookcase. The bookcase is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a sofa. The sofa is comfy. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can see an end table. You wonder idly who left that here. The end table appears to be empty.



There is a magazine on the floor.

Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is conventional. On the stove you make out a clean pan.

Well, here we are in a livingroom.

You can make out a bookcase. The bookcase contains a cushion. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a sofa. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You make out an end table. You shudder, but continue examining the end table. However, the end table, like an empty end table, has nothing on it.

-= Backyard =-
You arrive in a backyard. A normal one.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can make out a clothesline. The clothesline is ordinary. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can see a workbench. You shudder, but continue examining the workbench. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.



There is a wet maroon dress on the floor.
