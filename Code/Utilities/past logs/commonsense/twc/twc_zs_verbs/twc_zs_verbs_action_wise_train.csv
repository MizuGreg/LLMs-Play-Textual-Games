-= Laundry Room =-
You are in a laundry room. A normal one.

You can see a washing machine. The washing machine is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can see a suspended shelf. However, the suspended shelf, like an empty suspended shelf, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a bench. The bench is w. On the bench you see a dirty striped polo shirt and a dirty blue jumper.

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Laundry Room =-
You've just shown up in a laundry room.

You see a washing machine. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. The washing machine is empty! What a waste of a day! You make out a suspended shelf. The suspended shelf is normal. But there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a bench. The bench is w. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Laundry Room =-
Look at you, bigshot, walking into a laundry room like it isn't some huge deal. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see an opened washing machine. The washing machine is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You scan the room, seeing a suspended shelf. The suspended shelf is normal. On the suspended shelf you can see a dirty gray shirt. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this!



There is a washing powder on the floor.

-= Livingroom =-
You arrive in a livingroom. An usual one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

Look over there! a bookcase. The bookcase is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out a sofa. However, the sofa, like an empty sofa, has nothing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an end table. On the end table you can see a cushion and an old book. Classic TextWorld.



There is a magazine on the floor.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. An ordinary kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out a BBQ. On the BBQ you can see a wet jacket. You scan the room for a clothesline, and you find a clothesline. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio chair. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens!



There is a wet black T-shirt on the floor.

Of every kitchen you could have shown up in, you had to show up in a normal one.

You see an opened fridge in the corner. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can make out an opened kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard contains a yellow onion and a dirty mug. You can make out an opened dishwasher. The dishwasher is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out a dining table. The dining table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

Ah, the backyard. This is some kind of backyard, really great typical vibes in this place, a wonderful typical atmosphere.

You make out a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. On the BBQ you can make out a wet striped shirt. You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a clothesline. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a clothesline? However, the clothesline, like an empty clothesline, has nothing on it. You make out a workbench. The workbench is wooden. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a BBQ. The BBQ appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a clothesline. The clothesline is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a workbench. The workbench is wooden. On the workbench you make out a wet black T-shirt.

You find yourself in a bathroom. A normal one.

You can see an opened shower nearby. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a toilet. The toilet appears to be empty. You can make out a sink. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a dressing table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the dressing table.

There is an exit to the north.

There is a dirty white polo shirt on the floor.

You see a washing machine. The washing machine is empty, what a horrible day! You make out an opened laundry basket. The laundry basket is empty, what a horrible day! You can make out a bench. On the bench you can make out a lipstick.

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Pantry =-
You are in a pantry. A standard one.

Oh, great. Here's a shelf. The shelf is wooden. On the shelf you can make out some wastepaper. You can see a folding chair. The folding chair is wooden. On the folding chair you see some sugar. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now.

There is an open plain door leading east.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal one.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! Look over there! a kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard is empty! What a waste of a day! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a trash can. You wonder idly who left that here. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can see a dining table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open plain door leading west.

-= Laundry Room =-
You are in a laundry room. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a washing machine. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The washing machine is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out an opened laundry basket. The laundry basket is empty, what a horrible day!



There is a dirty tank top and a dirty brown skirt on the floor.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Bedroom =-
You've just shown up in a bedroom.

You make out an opened wardrobe, which looks large, in the room. The wardrobe is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can make out a chest of drawers. Huh, weird. What a letdown! The chest of drawers is empty! You see a bed. You see a pen on the bed. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an exit to the east.

There is a clean maroon skirt on the floor.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

 Choose your next action.Remember to express your action in the valid format and to surround the action between quotes ('')",user,0,0,1
4821,commonsense, go east,assistant,1,2,1
4821,commonsense," This is the present state of the game

-= Livingroom =-
You're not going to believe this, but you've just entered a livingroom. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You see a sofa. The sofa is comfy. The sofa appears to be empty. You see an end table. The end table appears to be empty. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an armchair. The armchair is comfortable. On the armchair you make out a clean gray skirt. Hmmm... what else, what else?

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Backyard =-
You've just shown up in a backyard.

You make out a BBQ. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The BBQ is recent. On the BBQ you make out a wet teal skirt. You can make out a clothesline. You wonder idly who left that here. The clothesline is standard. The clothesline appears to be empty. You see a patio chair. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.



There is a pair of wet white socks on the floor.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. It seems to be pretty typical here. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can make out an opened fridge right there by you. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard contains a pair of white golf shoes. You can make out an oven. The oven is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a dining table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. A standard one.

You make out a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. On the BBQ you can make out a wet striped blazer and a wet magenta dress. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You see a clothesline. The clothesline is standard. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You make out a workbench. The workbench is wooden. On the workbench you make out a wet cardigan.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

You've entered a backyard.

You can see a BBQ. However, the BBQ, like an empty BBQ, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well You make out a clothesline. The clothesline is standard. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. What's that over there? It looks like it's a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. On the patio chair you see a pair of wet gray socks.

There is an open sliding patio door leading south.

There is a wet gray polo shirt on the floor.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

You find yourself in a backyard. A typical one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ. Now why would someone leave that there? However, the BBQ, like an empty BBQ, has nothing on it. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You can make out a clothesline. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio chair. On the patio chair you can make out a wet maroon dress, a wet white skirt and a pair of wet white underpants.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Backyard =-
You've moved into an ordinary room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be ordinary. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the backyard. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call ""looking.""

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. However, the BBQ, like an empty BBQ, has nothing on it. You can see a clothesline! The clothesline is usual. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out a patio chair. Now why would someone leave that there? On the patio chair you make out a pair of wet checkered socks.



these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Bedroom =-
You are in a bedroom. An ordinary one. Let's see what's in here.

You see a wardrobe. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. The wardrobe is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a bed. The bed is large. On the bed you can see a clean blue dress. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a nightstand. The nightstand is typical. The nightstand appears to be empty.

You've just sauntered into a backyard. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You scan the room, seeing a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. On the BBQ you see a wet green dress. You can make out a clothesline. The clothesline is standard. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can make out a workbench. On the workbench you make out a wet blue bra.

-= Backyard =-
You're now in a backyard.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a BBQ. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a BBQ, go to TextWorld. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hey, want to see a clothesline? Look over there, a clothesline. But the thing is empty. You make out a patio chair. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. An usual kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see a wardrobe. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. What a letdown! The wardrobe is empty! You see a bed. You see a clean striped blazer on the bed. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a desk. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well



There is a checkered duvet and a copybook on the floor.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

You've just walked into a livingroom.

You can make out a sofa. On the sofa you make out a copybook. You make out an end table. The end table is wooden. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a grey carpet. The grey carpet is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Pantry =-
You're now in a pantry. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You make out a shelf! But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the shelf. You see a folding chair. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the folding chair.

There is an open plain door leading west.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You can see an opened fridge. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see a kitchen cupboard. What a letdown! The kitchen cupboard is empty! You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a dishwasher. Huh, weird. The dishwasher is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a dining table. The dining table is massive. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You can see a ladderback chair. The ladderback chair is solid. On the ladderback chair you make out a chicken breast, a red apple and a pork chop. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this!

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Bathroom =-
You are in a bathroom. An usual kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You see an opened shower, which looks normal, right there by you. The shower is empty, what a horrible day! You see a toilet. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a sink. But there isn't a thing on it. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a wall hook. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a bath mat. The bath mat is ordinary. However, the bath mat, like an empty bath mat, has nothing on it. You move on, clearly angry about TextWorld.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

There is some handsoap and an umbrella on the floor.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Kitchen =-
Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains some olive oil. Huh, weird. You can make out a kitchen cupboard. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. The kitchen cupboard contains a pork chop. Classic TextWorld. You make out a dishwasher. The dishwasher is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out a dining table. On the dining table you make out some black pepper. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best?

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Corridor =-
You've just walked into a corridor.

You see an umbrella stand. You wonder idly who left that here. The umbrella stand is standard. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is a brown belt and a clean blue shirt on the floor.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

 Choose your next action.Remember to express your action in the valid format and to surround the action between quotes ('')",user,0,0,1
12034,commonsense, go east,assistant,1,2,1
12034,commonsense," This is the present state of the game

-= Bedroom =-
Look at you, bigshot, walking into a bedroom like it isn't some huge deal.

Look over there! a wardrobe, so there's that. The wardrobe is empty, what a horrible day! You see a bed. The bed is large. On the bed you see a clean azure dress. You can make out a desk chair. The desk chair is ordinary. The desk chair appears to be empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

-= Livingroom =-
Ah, the livingroom. This is some kind of livingroom, really great usual vibes in this place, a wonderful usual atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see a sofa. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the sofa! oh well. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's an end table. You shudder, but continue examining the end table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see an armchair. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Pantry =-
You've entered a pantry.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a shelf. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The shelf is wooden. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You can make out a folding chair. The folding chair is wooden. On the folding chair you make out a red onion and a bread basket. Classic TextWorld.

There is an open plain door leading south.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An usual one. You begin looking for stuff.

You can make out an opened conventional looking fridge close by. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can make out an opened kitchen cupboard here. What a letdown! The kitchen cupboard is empty! You see a dining table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a dining table, go to TextWorld. The dining table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You make out a ladderback chair. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What's the point of an empty ladderback chair? You see a dining chair. You see some eggs on the dining chair. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Pantry =-
You arrive in a pantry. A normal kind of place.

You see a shelf. The shelf is wooden. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a folding chair. On the folding chair you can make out a bread basket and a clean cup.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Kitchen =-
You're now in the kitchen.

You smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge is empty, what a horrible day! Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! What's that over there? It looks like it's a trash can. Is this what you came to TextWorld for? This... trash can? The trash can is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a dining table. But there isn't a thing on it. You think about smashing the dining table to bits, throwing the bits into the garbage, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on. You see a ladderback chair. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom.

You make out an opened wardrobe. What a letdown! The wardrobe is empty! You make out a bed. The bed is large. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well You make out a dressing table. The dressing table is standard. On the dressing table you can make out a raincoat.



There is a plaid tie on the floor.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Livingroom =-
You've entered a livingroom.

You can make out a sofa. The sofa is comfy. However, the sofa, like an empty sofa, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the sofa. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an end table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You make out a coffee table. The coffee table is small. On the coffee table you see a cushion.



these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? An open kitchen cupboard is here. The kitchen cupboard contains an orange bell pepper. You make out a dining table. The dining table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. On the stove you can see a chicken breast.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Pantry =-
You arrive in a pantry. An usual one.

You can make out a shelf. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a shelf, go to TextWorld. The shelf is wooden. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the shelf. You see a folding chair. The folding chair is wooden. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Silly folding chair, silly, empty, good for nothing folding chair.

There is an open plain door leading south.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

You make out an opened fridge nearby. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You see an opened kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard is empty! What a waste of a day! You see an oven. Classic TextWorld. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a dining table. The dining table is massive. On the dining table you see a green bell pepper and a kettle. Now that's what I call TextWorld!

You see an opened wardrobe in the corner. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see a chest of drawers. The chest of drawers is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a bed. You see a clean black T-shirt on the bed.



There is a black duvet and a brown tie on the floor.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

Look over there! a fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see an opened kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard contains a red apple. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a dining table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see some milk.

-= Backyard =-
You've just walked into a backyard. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can make out a BBQ. Now why would someone leave that there? The BBQ is recent. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Look over there! a clothesline. The clothesline is typical. The clothesline appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a patio chair. On the patio chair you can see a yellow onion.

There is an open patio door leading south.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call ""looking.""

You see an opened fridge in the room. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You make out a kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard contains a wet white jumper. You can see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. The oven is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a dining table. But the thing is empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open patio door leading north.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call ""looking.""

You see an opened fridge in the room. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You make out a kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard is empty, what a horrible day! You can see an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. The oven is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a dining table. You see a wet white jumper on the dining table.

There is an open patio door leading north.

-= Backyard =-
You've just walked into a backyard. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can make out a BBQ. Now why would someone leave that there? The BBQ is recent. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Look over there! a clothesline. The clothesline is typical. The clothesline appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a patio chair. On the patio chair you can see a yellow onion.

There is an open patio door leading south.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Livingroom =-
Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a livingroom.

You see a sofa. The sofa is comfy. But the thing is empty. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an end table. But there isn't a thing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see an end table in a room. You can see an armchair. On the armchair you make out a top hat.

There is an exit to the west.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Corridor =-
You find yourself in a corridor. A normal one.

You make out a key holder. But the thing is empty. You see a hat rack. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

There is a derby hat on the floor.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Bathroom =-
You're now in the bathroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a shower. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The shower is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a toilet. The toilet is white. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You move on, clearly depressed by TextWorld. You see a sink. You wonder idly who left that here. The sink is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can make out a bath mat. The bath mat is typical. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. You can make out a bathtub. The bathtub is typical. But the thing is empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

There is a dirty black polo shirt on the floor.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Laundry Room =-
You are in a laundry room. A normal one.

You make out a washing machine. What a letdown! The washing machine is empty! You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a clothes drier. What a letdown! The clothes drier is empty!

There is an exit to the north.

There is a dirty plaid T-shirt on the floor.

-= Corridor =-
You've just walked into a corridor. You begin looking for stuff.

You can make out an opened shoe cabinet. The shoe cabinet contains a fleece jacket. You make out a coat hanger. The coat hanger is normal. The coat hanger appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the coat hanger.

There is an open sliding patio door leading north.

Well, here we are in the backyard. You can barely contain your excitement.

You see a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. On the BBQ you make out a pair of brown business shoes. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a clothesline. However, the clothesline, like an empty clothesline, has nothing on it. What's the point of an empty clothesline? You see a patio chair. The patio chair appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

-= Backyard =-
Well, here we are in the backyard. You can barely contain your excitement.

You see a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a clothesline. However, the clothesline, like an empty clothesline, has nothing on it. What's the point of an empty clothesline? You see a patio chair. You see a pair of brown business shoes on the patio chair.

There is an open sliding patio door leading south.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Bathroom =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bathroom.

You can see an opened shower. The shower contains a cleanser. You can make out a bathroom cabinet, so there's that. The bathroom cabinet is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out a toilet. The toilet is white. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. This always happens! You can see a sink. The sink appears to be empty.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Corridor =-
Of every corridor you could have walked into, you had to saunter into a normal one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a key holder. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You think about smashing the key holder to bits, throwing the bits into the garbage, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

There is some shampoo and a razor on the floor.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Livingroom =-
You're now in the livingroom.

Hey, want to see a bookcase? Look over there, a bookcase. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can see a sofa. The sofa is comfy. On the sofa you can see a magazine. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You see an end table. You shudder, but continue examining the end table. The end table is wooden. But there isn't a thing on it. You move on, clearly upset with TextWorld.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Corridor =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just moved into a corridor. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call ""looking.""

You make out an umbrella stand. The umbrella stand appears to be empty.

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is an old book on the floor.

You're now in the livingroom.

Hey, want to see a bookcase? Look over there, a bookcase. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can see a sofa. The sofa is comfy. On the sofa you can see a magazine. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You see an end table. You shudder, but continue examining the end table. The end table is wooden. But there isn't a thing on it. You move on, clearly upset with TextWorld.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. A typical one.

You make out an opened wardrobe nearby. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can see a bed. The bed is large. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You scan the room, seeing a desk. On the desk you can see a clean striped pullover.

There is an exit to the south.

There is a clean striped T-shirt on the floor.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Livingroom =-
You arrive in a livingroom. A standard kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see a sofa. The sofa is comfy. But there isn't a thing on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an end table. The end table is wooden. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You make out a TV stand. The TV stand appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand.

There is an exit to the north.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge is empty, what a horrible day! You see an opened conventional looking kitchen cupboard nearby. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You make out a dining table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh, great. Here's a ladderback chair. The ladderback chair is solid. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Livingroom =-
You arrive in a livingroom. An usual kind of place.

Hey, want to see a bookcase? Look over there, a bookcase. The bookcase contains a grater. You can make out a sofa. On the sofa you see a yellow onion and a clean glass. You can see an end table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

-= Pantry =-
This is going to sound unbelievable, but you've just entered a pantry. Let's see what's in here.

You make out a shelf. Now why would someone leave that there? However, the shelf, like an empty shelf, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the shelf! oh well. You can make out a folding chair. The folding chair is wooden. On the folding chair you can see a white onion.

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in a bedroom. An ordinary one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call ""looking.""

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a wardrobe. The wardrobe is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a bed. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You can make out a dressing table. The dressing table is standard. On the dressing table you can see a clean white jumper.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Kitchen =-
Ah, the kitchen. This is some kind of kitchen, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains some sugar. You can see a kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard is empty! What a waste of a day! What's that over there? It looks like it's a trash can. You wonder idly who left that here. The trash can is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out a dining table. You see a mixer on the dining table. Wow! Just like in the movies!

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

21547,commonsense," This is the present state of the game

-= Corridor =-
You are in a corridor. An usual one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You can make out an opened shoe cabinet, which looks ordinary, close by. The shoe cabinet is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can make out a hat rack. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a hat rack, go to TextWorld. The hat rack appears to be empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the hat rack.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

There is a pair of blue sneakers on the floor.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Backyard =-
You are in a backyard. An ordinary one. You can barely contain your excitement.

You scan the room, seeing a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. On the BBQ you see a wet plaid pullover. Classic TextWorld. You can see a clothesline. The clothesline appears to be empty. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a clothesline in a room. You make out a patio chair. On the patio chair you can see a wet brown jumper.

There is an open sliding patio door leading north.

You're now in a corridor.

Look over there! a shoe cabinet. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The shoe cabinet is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out a coat hanger. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What's the point of an empty coat hanger?

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Livingroom =-
You are in a livingroom. A typical one.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a wastepaper basket. The wastepaper basket is empty, what a horrible day! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a sofa. The sofa is comfy. The sofa appears to be empty. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an end table. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? The end table is wooden. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.



There is a magazine and an used tissue on the floor.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Corridor =-
Of every corridor you could have sauntered into, you had to come round an usual one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see a hat rack. The hat rack is normal. On the hat rack you see a clean yellow skirt. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a coat hanger. The coat hanger appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Bedroom =-
Ah, the bedroom. This is some kind of bedroom, really great usual vibes in this place, a wonderful usual atmosphere.

You can make out a wardrobe. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see an opened chest of drawers. The chest of drawers contains some clean gym clothes. You can see a bed. You see a brown belt on the bed.

There is an exit to the east.

Well, here we are in a pantry.

Were you looking for a shelf? Because look over there, it's a shelf. The shelf is wooden. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a folding chair. You see a can opener and a clean pot on the folding chair.

There is an open plain door leading east.

You've just walked into a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a fridge. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see an opened kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard is empty! What a waste of a day! Were you looking for a dining table? Because look over there, it's a dining table. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Hm. Oh well As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Hm. Oh well As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an open plain door leading west.

Well, here we are in a pantry.

Were you looking for a shelf? Because look over there, it's a shelf. The shelf is wooden. On the shelf you can see a clean pot and a can opener. You see a folding chair. However, the folding chair, like an empty folding chair, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Bathroom =-
You arrive in a bathroom. A standard one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You see a shower. The shower is empty, what a horrible day! You can make out a toilet. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But there isn't a thing on it. You make out a sink. The sink is standard. On the sink you can make out a dirty white shirt. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can make out a bathtub. You see a dirty magenta skirt on the bathtub.

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Laundry Room =-
You've just walked into a laundry room.

You can see an opened washing machine. What a letdown! The washing machine is empty! You can make out an opened clothes drier in the room. The clothes drier contains a dirty blue shirt. You wonder idly who left that here.

There is an exit to the north.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.

You see a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. On the BBQ you can see a pair of wet black socks. Look over there! a clothesline. You shudder, but continue examining the clothesline. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. On the patio chair you see a clean pot. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a workbench. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open sliding patio door leading south.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An usual one.

You can see an opened fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You make out a kitchen cupboard. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The kitchen cupboard is empty! What a waste of a day! You can see an oven. The oven is empty! What a waste of a day! Were you looking for a dining table? Because look over there, it's a dining table. You see a green bell pepper on the dining table. Now that's what I call TextWorld!

You can make out an opened standard looking washing machine close by. The washing machine is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out an opened laundry basket nearby. The laundry basket is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever!

You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You see an opened fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You see an opened kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard contains a white tuna. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out an opened cutlery drawer close by. The cutlery drawer is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a dining table. The dining table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open plain door leading north.

You arrive in a pantry. A normal kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You make out a shelf. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You see a folding chair. The folding chair is wooden. On the folding chair you make out a white onion. Hmmm... what else, what else?

-= Pantry =-
You arrive in a pantry. A normal kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You make out a shelf. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset. You see a folding chair. The folding chair is wooden. However, the folding chair, like an empty folding chair, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open plain door leading south.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

You scan the room, seeing a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a kitchen cupboard. What a letdown! The kitchen cupboard is empty! You make out an opened trash can, which looks typical, here. The trash can is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a dining table. The dining table is massive. On the dining table you can make out a grater.

You make out a washing machine. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You see a suspended shelf. You see a dirty purple skirt and a dirty black polo shirt on the suspended shelf. You see a work table. The work table is standard. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is a pair of dirty jeans on the floor.

You see a suspended shelf. You see a pair of dirty jeans, a dirty purple skirt and a dirty black polo shirt on the suspended shelf. You see a work table. The work table is standard. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Backyard =-
You are in a backyard. An usual one. You can barely contain your excitement.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a BBQ. On the BBQ you can see a wet checkered T-shirt. You can see a clothesline. However, the clothesline, like an empty clothesline, has nothing on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a patio table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.



these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Pantry =-
You make a grand eccentric entrance into a pantry.

You make out a shelf. But the thing is empty. You make out a folding chair. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a folding chair? The folding chair is wooden. On the folding chair you make out a spice container. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Kitchen =-
You have stumbled into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You see an opened fridge, which looks conventional, in the corner. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out a kitchen cupboard. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The kitchen cupboard contains a white tuna and a red bell pepper. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. An open dishwasher is in the room. The dishwasher is empty! What a waste of a day! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a dining table. The dining table is massive. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a dining chair. The dining chair is solid. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open frosted-glass door leading north.

-= Pantry =-
You make a grand eccentric entrance into a pantry.

You make out a shelf. But the thing is empty. You make out a folding chair. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a folding chair? The folding chair is wooden. On the folding chair you make out a spice container. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south.

You have stumbled into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You see an opened fridge, which looks conventional, in the corner. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out a kitchen cupboard. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The kitchen cupboard contains a white tuna and a red bell pepper. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. An open dishwasher is in the room. The dishwasher is empty! What a waste of a day! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a dining table. The dining table is massive. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a dining chair. The dining chair is solid. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Livingroom =-
You arrive in a livingroom. An ordinary kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You can see a sofa. The sofa is comfy. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly. Were you looking for an end table? Because look over there, it's an end table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a side table. The side table is wooden, small. The side table appears to be empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Kitchen =-
You've just walked into a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. The fridge contains a rotten yellow apple. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see an opened kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard is empty, what a horrible day! You can make out a trash can. What a letdown! The trash can is empty! You scan the room for a dining table, and you find a dining table. You see an apron on the dining table. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a ladderback chair. You see a bread basket on the ladderback chair.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

-= Livingroom =-
You arrive in a livingroom. An ordinary kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You can see a sofa. The sofa is comfy. On the sofa you make out a rotten yellow apple. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? Were you looking for an end table? Because look over there, it's an end table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a side table. The side table is wooden, small. The side table appears to be empty.

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Backyard =-
You arrive in a backyard. An ordinary kind of place.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a clothesline. But there isn't a thing on it. You scan the room for a patio table, and you find a patio table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a patio table, go to TextWorld. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.



There is a wet white skirt and a wet teal skirt on the floor.

-= Bathroom =-
You're now in the bathroom. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call ""looking.""

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a shower. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? What a letdown! The shower is empty! You can make out a toilet. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a sink. The sink is usual. On the sink you make out a dirty brown blazer. Hey, want to see a towel rail? Look over there, a towel rail. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The towel rail is typical. The towel rail appears to be empty.

There is an exit to the east.

Ah, the laundry room. This is some kind of laundry room, really great ordinary vibes in this place, a wonderful ordinary atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.

You make out a washing machine. The washing machine is empty, what a horrible day! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a laundry basket. Classic TextWorld. The laundry basket is empty, what a horrible day!

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a washing machine. The washing machine is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a laundry basket. The laundry basket is empty! What a waste of a day!



There is a pair of dirty jeans on the floor.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A typical one.

You can see an opened fridge in the corner. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can make out an opened conventional looking kitchen cupboard in the room. The kitchen cupboard contains a green bell pepper. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a dining table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a dining table? You see a clean colander on the dining table. You see a ladderback chair. The ladderback chair is solid. On the ladderback chair you can make out a clean cup.

You can see a shelf. The shelf is wooden. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You make out a folding chair. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the folding chair you can make out a yellow onion, some peanut oil and some olive oil.

-= Corridor =-
Well, here we are in a corridor. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can make out a hat rack. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the hat rack! oh well.

There is an open screen door leading west.

There is a wet magenta dress and a wet gray blazer on the floor.

-= Backyard =-
You've entered a backyard.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. On the BBQ you see a wet hawaiian shirt. You can see a clothesline. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The clothesline is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You can make out a workbench. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open screen door leading east.

-= Backyard =-
You've entered a backyard.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. On the BBQ you see a wet hawaiian shirt. You can see a clothesline. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The clothesline is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You can make out a workbench. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an open screen door leading east.

-= Livingroom =-
Well I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a livingroom.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a sofa. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a magazine on the sofa. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an end table. The end table is wooden. However, the end table, like an empty end table, has nothing on it. You make out an armchair. You see a pen on the armchair. Hmmm... what else, what else?



There is a cushion on the floor.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Bedroom =-
You've just walked into a bedroom.

You can make out an opened wardrobe, which looks large, in the corner. The wardrobe contains a lip liner. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a bed. The bed is large. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You can make out a dressing table. The dressing table appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!



There is a black duvet and a clean orange T-shirt on the floor.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Kitchen =-
You're now in the kitchen.

You see an opened fridge right there by you. The fridge is empty, what a horrible day! You make out a kitchen cupboard. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? Hey, want to see a dining table? Look over there, a dining table. The dining table is massive. On the dining table you can make out a bread basket. Hmmm... what else, what else? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Livingroom =-
You've just shown up in a livingroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a bookcase. The bookcase is empty, what a horrible day! Were you looking for a sofa? Because look over there, it's a sofa. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a sofa? On the sofa you can see a clean pressure cooker. You make out an end table. You wonder idly who left that here. The end table is wooden. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You smell a great smell, and follow it to a side table. You see a clean glass on the side table, so there's that.

There is an exit to the west.

-= Livingroom =-
You've just shown up in a livingroom. You begin to take stock of what's here.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a bookcase. The bookcase is empty, what a horrible day! Were you looking for a sofa? Because look over there, it's a sofa. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a sofa? On the sofa you can see a clean pressure cooker. You make out an end table. You wonder idly who left that here. The end table is wooden. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You smell a great smell, and follow it to a side table. You see a clean glass on the side table, so there's that.

There is an exit to the west.

You're now in the kitchen.

You see an opened fridge right there by you. The fridge is empty, what a horrible day! You make out a kitchen cupboard. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? Hey, want to see a dining table? Look over there, a dining table. The dining table is massive. On the dining table you can make out a bread basket. Hmmm... what else, what else? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Bathroom =-
You're now in the bathroom.

You scan the room for a shower, and you find a shower. The shower is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out a toilet. You shudder, but continue examining the toilet. The toilet is white. On the toilet you make out some shampoo. You scan the room for a sink, and you find a sink. The sink is usual. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can make out a wall hook. However, the wall hook, like an empty wall hook, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!



There is a bathrobe and some handsoap on the floor.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Backyard =-
You're now in the backyard.

You can make out a BBQ. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a clothesline. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a clothesline? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a workbench. On the workbench you see a pair of wet black socks.

You're now in a bedroom.

You make out an opened wardrobe, which looks large, here. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can see a chest of drawers. Now why would someone leave that there? The chest of drawers is empty! What a waste of a day! You make out a bed. But the thing is empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?



There is a plaid duvet, a clean azure dress and a blue belt on the floor.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A normal one.

You make out an opened fridge, which looks conventional, in the room. The fridge is empty, what a horrible day! You make out a kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! Look over there! a trash can. Classic TextWorld. The trash can is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out a dining table. The dining table appears to be empty.

There is an open sliding patio door leading north.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Backyard =-
You are in a backyard. An ordinary one.

Look over there! a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. On the BBQ you can see some wastepaper. You see a clothesline. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a patio table. The patio table is stylish. On the patio table you can see a clean pressure cooker.

There is an open sliding patio door leading south.

-= Bedroom =-
You arrive in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a bedroom. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You can see an opened wardrobe. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can see a bed. You see a clean green T-shirt and a pair of clean dress pants on the bed. Hey, want to see a desk chair? Look over there, a desk chair. The desk chair is ordinary. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

-= Bedroom =-
Ah, the bedroom. This is some kind of bedroom, really great normal vibes in this place, a wonderful normal atmosphere. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a wardrobe. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The wardrobe contains a copybook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. Look over there! a bed. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a bed? The bed is large. However, the bed, like an empty bed, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a desk. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.



There is a gray duvet and a clean yellow dress on the floor.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Bathroom =-
You have come into a bathroom. Not the bathroom you'd expect. No, this is a bathroom. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call ""looking.""

An open normal looking shower is here. What a letdown! The shower is empty! You see a pedal bin. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The pedal bin is empty, what a horrible day! You can see a bathroom cabinet! The bathroom cabinet contains a rotten red tuna and a rotten yellow potato. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a toilet. The toilet is white. On the toilet you make out some shampoo. You see a sink. The sink is normal. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What's the point of an empty sink? You make out a towel rail. The towel rail is typical. But the thing is empty. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a bathtub. However, the bathtub, like an empty bathtub, has nothing on it.



There is some handsoap and an used tissue on the floor.

-= Livingroom =-
You find yourself in a livingroom. A normal kind of place.

You see a sofa. The sofa is comfy. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an end table. The end table is wooden. On the end table you make out a derby hat. Wow! Just like in the movies! You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a TV stand. The TV stand is ordinary. But the thing is empty.

There is an exit to the south.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

You see a hat rack. The hat rack is ordinary. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is a cushion on the floor.

You see a sofa. The sofa is comfy. On the sofa you see a derby hat. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an end table. The end table is wooden. But there isn't a thing on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a TV stand. The TV stand is ordinary. But the thing is empty.

There is an exit to the south.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Bathroom =-
You arrive in a bathroom. A standard one.

You see a shower. What a letdown! The shower is empty! You make out an opened pedal bin. The pedal bin is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out a toilet. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You see a sink. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You see a dressing table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a dressing table? The dressing table is ordinary. On the dressing table you make out a rotten red potato, a rotten yellow apple and some shampoo.



these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Livingroom =-
You are in a livingroom. A standard kind of place.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a sofa. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see an end table. The end table is wooden. But the thing is empty. You move on, clearly depressed by your TextWorld experience. Were you looking for an armchair? Because look over there, it's an armchair. The armchair is comfortable. On the armchair you can make out a magazine and a long coat.

There is an exit to the north.

-= Corridor =-
You arrive in a corridor. An ordinary one.

You can see a coat hanger. The coat hanger is typical. However, the coat hanger, like an empty coat hanger, has nothing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

There is a fleece jacket on the floor.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Livingroom =-
You are in a livingroom. A standard kind of place.

You make out a sofa. The sofa is comfy. On the sofa you make out a can opener. You make out an end table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The end table is wooden. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a coffee table. But the thing is empty.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

You find yourself in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You can see an opened fridge. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a kitchen cupboard. Huh, weird. The kitchen cupboard contains a chicken wing. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You can make out a trash can. What a letdown! The trash can is empty! You make out a dining table. The dining table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

-= Livingroom =-
You are in a livingroom. A standard kind of place.

You make out a sofa. The sofa is comfy. On the sofa you make out a can opener. You make out an end table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The end table is wooden. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a coffee table. But the thing is empty.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You can see an opened fridge. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a kitchen cupboard. Huh, weird. The kitchen cupboard contains a chicken wing. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You can make out a trash can. What a letdown! The trash can is empty! You make out a dining table. The dining table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Corridor =-
You arrive in a corridor. A standard kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You see a key holder. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well

There is an exit to the west.

-= Bedroom =-
You find yourself in a bedroom. A normal one.

You make out an opened wardrobe. The wardrobe is empty, what a horrible day! You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a desk. The desk is usual. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You can see a dark carpet. On the dark carpet you can see a black belt. Huh, weird.

You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

There is a gray duvet on the floor.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Pantry =-
You've entered a pantry. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a shelf. You wonder idly who left that here. The shelf is wooden. The shelf appears to be empty. You see a folding chair. The folding chair is wooden. On the folding chair you see some peanut oil. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things.



these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Laundry Room =-
You are in a laundry room. An ordinary one.

You can see a washing machine. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. The washing machine is empty, what a horrible day! You can make out a suspended shelf. The suspended shelf is standard. On the suspended shelf you make out a dirty blue jumper.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is some handsoap on the floor.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

 Choose your next action.Remember to express your action in the valid format and to surround the action between quotes ('')",user,0,0,1

36425,commonsense," This is the present state of the game

-= Bathroom =-
This might come as a shock to you, but you've just stumbled into a bathroom.

You can make out an opened shower. What a letdown! The shower is empty! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a toilet. The toilet is white. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a sink. The sink is typical. On the sink you see a dirty black polo shirt. You can see a towel rail. The towel rail is ordinary. But the thing is empty.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

You are in a kitchen. A typical one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

An open fridge is in the room. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can see a kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard is empty! What a waste of a day! Hey, want to see a cutlery drawer? Look over there, a cutlery drawer. The cutlery drawer is empty, what a horrible day! Oh, great. Here's a dining table. The dining table is massive. On the dining table you make out some sugar. You scan the room, seeing a ladderback chair. The ladderback chair is solid. On the ladderback chair you see a chicken leg and a potato peeler.

There is an exit to the south.

Well, here we are in the corridor.

You can see a hat rack. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The hat rack is typical. On the hat rack you can see a chicken leg. Hmmm... what else, what else?

You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A typical one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

An open fridge is in the room. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can see a kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard is empty! What a waste of a day! Hey, want to see a cutlery drawer? Look over there, a cutlery drawer. The cutlery drawer is empty, what a horrible day! Oh, great. Here's a dining table. The dining table is massive. On the dining table you make out some sugar. You scan the room, seeing a ladderback chair. The ladderback chair is solid. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an exit to the south.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You can see a kitchen cupboard. Is this it? Is this what you came to TextWorld to see? a kitchen cupboard? What a letdown! The kitchen cupboard is empty! You can make out a dining table. On the dining table you can make out a grater. You see a counter. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

There is an open patio door leading south.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. You can barely contain your excitement.

You scan the room, seeing a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. On the BBQ you can see a wet brown jumper. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can see a clothesline. However, the clothesline, like an empty clothesline, has nothing on it. What's the point of an empty clothesline? You see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. On the patio table you make out a bread basket.

There is an open patio door leading north.

-= Laundry Room =-
You find yourself in a laundry room. An ordinary kind of place.

You see a washing machine. The washing machine is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a work table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The work table is ordinary. On the work table you can make out a black coat.

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

There is a dirty green T-shirt on the floor.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Corridor =-
You're now in the corridor. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You make out a coat hanger. The coat hanger is usual. But the thing is empty. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is a pair of dirty plaid socks on the floor.

-= Backyard =-
Well, here we are in a backyard.

You can see a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What's that over there? It looks like it's a clothesline. The clothesline is ordinary. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You see a patio table. You see a wet plaid polo shirt on the patio table. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this!

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Kitchen =-
Look at that board! What does it say? It says Welcome to the kitchen? Well that's cool.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. The fridge is empty, what a horrible day! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard is empty, what a horrible day! You see a dining table. The dining table is massive. On the dining table you see a green bell pepper. You can see a ladderback chair. On the ladderback chair you can see a red hot pepper. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting.

There is an open plain door leading north.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

39325,commonsense," This is the present state of the game

-= Pantry =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so ordinary all of a sudden, it's because you've just sauntered into the pantry. You can barely contain your excitement.

You make out a shelf. But the thing is empty. You make out a folding chair. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open plain door leading south.

Look over there! a fridge. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You can make out an opened kitchen cupboard here. The kitchen cupboard is empty, what a horrible day! You can see a dining table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a dining chair. The dining chair is solid. On the dining chair you can make out a clean pressure cooker. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a dining chair. The dining chair is solid. On the dining chair you can make out a clean pressure cooker. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open plain door leading north.

You've just walked into a pantry.

You see a shelf. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a shelf, go to TextWorld. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hey, want to see a folding chair? Look over there, a folding chair. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!

There is an open plain door leading north.

You've just shown up in a kitchen.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can see an opened kitchen cupboard. What a letdown! The kitchen cupboard is empty! You make out an opened trash can. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can see a dining table. The dining table is massive. On the dining table you can see a clean pan. You make out a dining chair. But the thing is empty.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Pantry =-
You're now in a pantry.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a shelf. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a folding chair. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an open plain door leading east.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Kitchen =-
You've just walked into a kitchen.

You see a fridge, so there's that. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You scan the room, seeing a kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard contains some eggs and a dirty spatula. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a dishwasher. Classic TextWorld. The dishwasher is empty, what a horrible day! You can see a dining table. The dining table is massive. The dining table appears to be empty.

You've just sauntered into a livingroom. Let's see what's in here.

Oh, great. Here's a sofa. You see a magazine on the sofa. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an end table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a side table. The side table is wooden, small. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. This always happens!

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Backyard =-
You've entered a backyard. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a BBQ. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You move on, clearly upset by TextWorld. You can see a clothesline. The clothesline is normal. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a workbench. The workbench is wooden. On the workbench you see a wet black T-shirt.

There is an open patio door leading north.

There is a wet brown jumper on the floor.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Bathroom =-
You're now in the bathroom.

You can make out an opened shower. The shower is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a toilet. However, the toilet, like an empty toilet, has nothing on it. Look over there! a sink. You see a bathrobe on the sink. You can make out a wall hook. You shudder, but continue examining the wall hook. The wall hook is ordinary. But there isn't a thing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a wall hook in a room.



There is some shampoo and some handsoap on the floor.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Pantry =-
You have fallen into the most ordinary of all possible pantrys. You can barely contain your excitement.

Look over there! a shelf. The shelf is wooden. On the shelf you can see a clean pan. You shudder, but continue examining the room. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a folding chair. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an open plain door leading south.

You arrive in a kitchen. A normal one.

You see a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You make out an opened kitchen cupboard nearby. What a letdown! The kitchen cupboard is empty! Hey, want to see a dining table? Look over there, a dining table. The dining table is massive. On the dining table you make out a red bell pepper. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can see a ladderback chair! The ladderback chair is solid. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Pantry =-
You are in a pantry. A normal kind of place.

You can make out a shelf. On the shelf you can make out a kettle and a bread basket. You can see a folding chair. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open plain door leading west.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a kitchen cupboard. Now why would someone leave that there? What a letdown! The kitchen cupboard is empty! Look over there! a dining table. The dining table appears to be empty. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a dining chair. You shudder, but continue examining the dining chair. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open plain door leading east.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Corridor =-
You are in a corridor. An ordinary one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

Were you looking for a hat rack? Because look over there, it's a hat rack. The hat rack is normal. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

There is a clean gray jumper on the floor.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom.

You can see an opened wardrobe in the corner. The wardrobe is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can make out a desk. The desk appears to be empty. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. The nightstand is ordinary. On the nightstand you see a clean gray T-shirt.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

You've entered a bedroom.

You can see an opened wardrobe in the corner. The wardrobe is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can make out a desk. The desk appears to be empty. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button.

You scan the room, seeing a washing machine. The washing machine is empty, what a horrible day! Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a work table. You see a blue coat on the work table.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

You find yourself in a corridor. A normal one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can make out a coat hanger. The coat hanger is standard. But the thing is empty. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst.

There is an exit to the south.

There is a gray coat and a dirty checkered shirt on the floor.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

You are in a bathroom. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a shower. The shower is empty! What a waste of a day! You can see a toilet. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well You can make out a sink. The sink is standard. On the sink you can make out a dirty yellow skirt. You see a dressing table. The dressing table is ordinary. But there isn't a thing on it.

-= Laundry Room =-
I just think it's great that you've just entered a laundry room. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

Hey, want to see a washing machine? Look over there, a washing machine. The washing machine is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can see a laundry basket. The laundry basket is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is a dirty hoodie on the floor.

-= Bathroom =-
You are in a bathroom. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a shower. The shower is empty! What a waste of a day! You can see a toilet. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hm. Oh well You can make out a sink. The sink is standard. However, the sink, like an empty sink, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the sink. You see a dressing table. The dressing table is ordinary. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the west.

You make out a shelf. But there isn't a thing on it. You scan the room for a folding chair, and you find a folding chair. You see some eggs, a red onion and some sugar on the folding chair. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Corridor =-
You have fallen into a corridor. Not the corridor you'd expect. No, this is a corridor. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

Oh, great. Here's an umbrella stand. The umbrella stand appears to be empty. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a coat hanger. But the thing is empty.



There is an umbrella, a scarf and a gray coat on the floor.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Bathroom =-
You've just sauntered into a bathroom.

You see a shower. The shower contains a brush. You see a bathroom cabinet. What a letdown! The bathroom cabinet is empty! You can make out a toilet. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You see an electric razor on the toilet. Were you looking for a sink? Because look over there, it's a sink. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.



There is a hair brush on the floor.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge! The fridge contains some sugar. Look over there! a kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can make out a trash can. What a letdown! The trash can is empty! Look over there! a dining table. The dining table is massive. On the dining table you can make out a can opener and a clean glass.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Livingroom =-
You find yourself in a livingroom. A normal one. You begin looking for stuff.

You make out a sofa. The sofa is comfy. On the sofa you see a chicken breast, a green bell pepper and a clean pan. You can make out an end table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for an end table, go to TextWorld. The end table is wooden. However, the end table, like an empty end table, has nothing on it. You can see an armchair. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about an armchair? But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the north.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. The room is well lit.

You can see a fridge. The fridge is empty, what a horrible day! You can see a kitchen cupboard. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The kitchen cupboard is empty! What a waste of a day! An open trash can is nearby. What a letdown! The trash can is empty! You can make out a dining table. You wonder idly who left that here. But there isn't a thing on it. You move on, clearly done caring about your TextWorld experience.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. The room is well lit.

You can see a fridge. The fridge is empty, what a horrible day! You can see a kitchen cupboard. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The kitchen cupboard is empty! What a waste of a day! An open trash can is nearby. What a letdown! The trash can is empty! You can make out a dining table. You wonder idly who left that here. But there isn't a thing on it. You move on, clearly done caring about your TextWorld experience.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Bathroom =-
You are in a bathroom. An usual kind of place.

You scan the room for a shower, and you find a shower. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a toilet. You see some shampoo on the toilet. You can see a sink. The sink is usual. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a wall hook. But the thing is empty.

On the sofa you see a magazine and some wastepaper. Classic TextWorld. You make out an end table. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?



There is a cushion on the floor.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Bathroom =-
You find yourself in a bathroom. A normal one.

Were you looking for a shower? Because look over there, it's a shower! The shower is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out a toilet. The toilet is white. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You move on, clearly angry about TextWorld. Were you looking for a sink? Because look over there, it's a sink. The sink is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a dressing table. The dressing table appears to be empty. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!

There is an exit to the east.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Laundry Room =-
If you're wondering why everything seems so usual all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the laundry room.

You scan the room for a washing machine, and you find a washing machine. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out an opened laundry basket, which looks typical, nearby. What a letdown! The laundry basket is empty!

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is a dirty magenta skirt, a pair of dirty brown socks and a dirty checkered shirt on the floor.

Well, here we are in the livingroom.

An open wastepaper basket is right there by you. The wastepaper basket is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out a sofa. The sofa is comfy. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an end table. The end table is wooden. The end table appears to be empty.



There is a pen on the floor.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

You scan the room for a sofa, and you find a sofa. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see an end table. You see a cushion on the end table. You make out a TV stand. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.



these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can see an opened fridge nearby. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You make out an opened kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard is empty, what a horrible day! You can make out a dining table! The dining table is massive. On the dining table you see a kettle and a blender. Oh, great. Here's a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. What's the point of an empty counter?

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Livingroom =-
You are in a livingroom. A standard one.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a sofa. The sofa is comfy. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a sofa in a room. Were you looking for an end table? Because look over there, it's an end table. You see a cushion on the end table. You can see a TV stand. You see a magazine on the TV stand. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things.



these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

I am sorry to announce that you are now in the bedroom.

You can see an opened wardrobe close by. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a bed. The bed is large. On the bed you make out a raincoat. You can make out a nightstand. Now why would someone leave that there? The nightstand is ordinary. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Hm. Oh well

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Livingroom =-
You've just walked into a livingroom. The room is well lit.

You make out a wastepaper basket. The wastepaper basket is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out a sofa. The sofa is comfy. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. On the end table you see some wastepaper.

There is an exit to the north.

There is a copybook on the floor.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Corridor =-
You find yourself in a corridor.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a key holder. The key holder is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an exit to the south.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Pantry =-
You find yourself in a standard kind of place. That is to say, you're in a pantry. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You make out a shelf. The shelf is wooden. However, the shelf, like an empty shelf, has nothing on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a folding chair. The folding chair is wooden. On the folding chair you see a yellow onion and a red onion.



these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Bathroom =-
You arrive in a bathroom. A standard kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out an opened shower. The shower is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out a toilet. The toilet is white. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. What's that over there? It looks like it's a sink. The sink is standard. On the sink you see a pair of gray business shoes. You can make out a wall hook. The wall hook is typical. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a dressing table. The dressing table is normal. The dressing table appears to be empty. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a dressing table in a room.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

There is a pair of white moccasins on the floor.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is some handsoap on the floor.

You can make out a wall hook. The wall hook is typical. On the wall hook you make out a pair of white moccasins. You see a dressing table. The dressing table is normal. The dressing table appears to be empty. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a dressing table in a room.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom.

You see a wardrobe. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The wardrobe is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can see an opened chest of drawers. The chest of drawers contains a clean striped shirt. You can see a bed. But there isn't a thing on it. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience! You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a dressing table. On the dressing table you see a clean black shirt and a pair of clean brown socks.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Corridor =-
You're now in the corridor.

You can see a hat rack. You shudder, but continue examining the hat rack. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

You make another one of your grand eccentric entrances into a corridor.

You can see a hat rack. The hat rack is ordinary. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the hat rack.



There is a straw hat on the floor.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a fridge, so there's that. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! Were you looking for a kitchen cupboard? Because look over there, it's a kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard is empty, what a horrible day! You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a trash can, so there's that. The trash can is empty, what a horrible day! You can make out a dining table. You see a clean colander on the dining table.

You arrive in a bedroom. An usual kind of place.

You can see an opened wardrobe. The wardrobe is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out a bed. You see a clean blue shirt on the bed. Were you looking for a dark carpet? Because look over there, it's a dark carpet. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a dark carpet? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Silly dark carpet, silly, empty, good for nothing dark carpet. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a desk chair. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Corridor =-
Well, here we are in a corridor.

You can see a key holder. The key holder is ordinary. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well

You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

There is a copybook on the floor.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Livingroom =-
You arrive in a livingroom. A typical kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a sofa. You see a magazine on the sofa. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You make out an end table. The end table is wooden. However, the end table, like an empty end table, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a coffee table. The coffee table is small. On the coffee table you can see a pen. You make out an armchair. The armchair is comfortable. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Bathroom =-
Well, here we are in a bathroom.

Look over there! a shower. The shower is empty, what a horrible day! You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a toilet. The toilet is white. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a sink. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a sink? The sink is ordinary. The sink appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can see a dressing table. You see a dirty azure dress on the dressing table. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

There is a dirty brown skirt on the floor.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Laundry Room =-
You arrive in a laundry room. A typical one.

Oh, great. Here's a washing machine. The washing machine contains a pair of wet gray socks. You see an opened clothes drier, which looks standard, in the corner. The clothes drier is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can make out a work table. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

-= Bathroom =-
Well, here we are in a bathroom.

Look over there! a shower. The shower is empty, what a horrible day! You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a toilet. The toilet is white. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a sink. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a sink? The sink is ordinary. The sink appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can see a dressing table. You see a dirty azure dress on the dressing table. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

There is a dirty brown skirt on the floor.

Oh, great. Here's a washing machine. The washing machine contains a pair of wet gray socks. You see an opened clothes drier, which looks standard, in the corner. The clothes drier is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can make out a work table. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

-= Laundry Room =-
You've just shown up in a laundry room. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call ""looking.""

You see a washing machine. What a letdown! The washing machine is empty! Oh, great. Here's a suspended shelf. The suspended shelf is normal. On the suspended shelf you can make out an umbrella.

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a fridge. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a cutlery drawer. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The cutlery drawer is empty, what a horrible day! Oh, great.

You're now in the pantry.

You can make out a shelf. Now why would someone leave that there? The shelf is wooden. But there isn't a thing on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a folding chair. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south.

You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You can make out an opened fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a kitchen cupboard. Classic TextWorld. The kitchen cupboard is empty, what a horrible day! What's that over there? It looks like it's a cutlery drawer. The cutlery drawer is empty, what a horrible day! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a dining table. The dining table is massive. On the dining table you can see a red apple and a block of cheese. Hmmm... what else, what else?

You're now in the pantry.

You can make out a shelf. Now why would someone leave that there? The shelf is wooden. But there isn't a thing on it. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a folding chair. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south.

You arrive in a livingroom. A standard one.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a wastepaper basket. The wastepaper basket is empty, what a horrible day! You can make out a sofa. You see a magazine on the sofa. You see an end table. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the end table.

You find yourself in a backyard. An usual one. You can barely contain your excitement.

You see a BBQ. You see a pair of wet striped socks on the BBQ. You make out a clothesline. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a workbench. The workbench is wooden. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Pantry =-
Well, here we are in the pantry.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a shelf. But the thing is empty. You smell a lovely smell, and follow it to a folding chair. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a folding chair? The folding chair is wooden. On the folding chair you can make out a red onion.

Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south.

Well, here we are in a kitchen.

You see an opened fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out a kitchen cupboard. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? The kitchen cupboard is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! Oh, great. Here's a dining table. But the thing is empty. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a clean cup. Huh, weird.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading north.

Fancy seeing you here. Here, by the way, being the kitchen.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge contains some black pepper. You can make out a kitchen cupboard. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The kitchen cupboard contains a clean strainer. You can see a cutlery drawer. What a letdown! The cutlery drawer is empty! You can make out an opened oven, which looks usual, in the corner. What a letdown! The oven is empty! Were you looking for a dining table? Because look over there, it's a dining table. You see a clean ladle on the dining table.

There is an exit to the west.

You can make out an umbrella stand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for an umbrella stand, go to TextWorld. The umbrella stand is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in a bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a wardrobe. You shudder, but continue examining the room. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You make out a bed. Now why would someone leave that there? On the bed you can make out a clean brown shirt. You scan the room for a desk chair, and you find a desk chair. The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You make out a nightstand. The nightstand is usual. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

-= Livingroom =-
You've entered a livingroom.

You can see a sofa. On the sofa you make out a black coat and a clean green T-shirt. You can make out an end table. The end table is wooden. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to an armchair. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

-= Bedroom =-
You're now in a bedroom. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You smell a wretched smell, and follow it to a wardrobe. You shudder, but continue examining the room. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You make out a bed. Now why would someone leave that there? On the bed you can make out a clean brown shirt. You scan the room for a desk chair, and you find a desk chair. The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You make out a nightstand. The nightstand is usual. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

This might come as a shock to you, but you've just entered a bathroom.

An open usual looking shower is nearby. The shower contains a razor. You can see a bathroom cabinet. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The bathroom cabinet is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a toilet. The toilet is white. On the toilet you can make out some shampoo. You can make out a sink. The sink is normal. The sink appears to be empty.



There is a box of Q-tips on the floor.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Pantry =-
You've fallen into an usual room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be usual. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the pantry. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You see a shelf. You shudder, but continue examining the shelf. The shelf is wooden. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You can see a folding chair. On the folding chair you make out a mixer.

There is an open plain door leading south.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An usual one.

Were you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You scan the room, seeing a kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard is empty, what a horrible day! Were you looking for a dishwasher? Because look over there, it's a dishwasher. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? Look over there! a cutlery drawer. The cutlery drawer is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a dining table. You see a red hot pepper and a green hot pepper on the dining table.

There is an open plain door leading north.

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge is empty, what a horrible day! You see an opened kitchen cupboard here. The kitchen cupboard contains a pair of gray sneakers. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a trash can. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a dining table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a dining table, go to TextWorld. The dining table is massive. On the dining table you can make out a pair of gray moccasins. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting.

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

Were you looking for a shoe cabinet? Because look over there, it's a shoe cabinet. The shoe cabinet is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever!

There is an exit to the east.

There is a pair of gray golf shoes on the floor.

You are in a corridor. A typical kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

Were you looking for a shoe cabinet? Because look over there, it's a shoe cabinet. The shoe cabinet is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever!

There is an exit to the east.

You've entered a kitchen.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge is empty, what a horrible day! You see a closed kitchen cupboard here. You can make out a trash can. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a dining table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a dining table, go to TextWorld. The dining table is massive. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You can see a key holder. The key holder is typical. The key holder appears to be empty. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a key holder in a room. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a hat rack. The hat rack appears to be empty.

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Corridor =-
You've just walked into a corridor.

You can see an umbrella stand. The umbrella stand is standard. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What's the point of an empty umbrella stand?

There is an exit to the west.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Livingroom =-
You arrive in a livingroom. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You see a bookcase. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The bookcase contains a pen. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You scan the room for a sofa, and you find a sofa. But there isn't a thing on it. What's that over there? It looks like it's an end table. However, the end table, like an empty end table, has nothing on it. You can make out a side table. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a side table? You see a cushion on the side table.

There is an exit to the east.

The toilet is white. The toilet appears to be empty. You see a sink. The sink is ordinary. On the sink you can see a dirty purple T-shirt. You can see a bath mat. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bath mat! oh well. You see a bathtub. The bathtub is typical. But there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the bathtub.

There is an exit to the west.

There is a dirty black pullover on the floor.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

You arrive in a pantry. Let's see what's in here.

Were you looking for a shelf? Because look over there, it's a shelf. The shelf is wooden. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a folding chair. On the folding chair you make out a white onion, some eggs and some olive oil. Wow! Just like in the movies!

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Kitchen =-
You're now in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can see an opened fridge close by. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out an opened kitchen cupboard in the room. The kitchen cupboard contains some eggs and a chicken leg. Oh, great. Here's a dishwasher. Huh, weird. What a letdown! The dishwasher is empty! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a dining table. The dining table is massive. On the dining table you see a yellow bell pepper. Now that's what I call TextWorld!
