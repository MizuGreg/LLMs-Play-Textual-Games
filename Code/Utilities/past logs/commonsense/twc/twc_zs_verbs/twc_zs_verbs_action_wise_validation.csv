Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Corridor =-
You arrive in a corridor. An usual kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call ""looking.""

Were you looking for an umbrella stand? Because look over there, it's an umbrella stand. The umbrella stand is ordinary. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What's the point of an empty umbrella stand? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a coat hanger. But there isn't a thing on it.



There is an umbrella, a fleece jacket and a gray coat on the floor.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Livingroom =-
You are in a livingroom. A standard one.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a sofa. The sofa is comfy. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a sofa in a room. Were you looking for an end table? Because look over there, it's an end table. You see a cushion on the end table. You can see a TV stand. You see a magazine on the TV stand. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things.



these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].
