Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be good if you could go to the west. Following that, retrieve the coin from the floor of the steam room. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Bedchamber =-
Well, here we are in the bedchamber.



There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First stop, take a trip south. After that, try to venture west. After that, pick-up the coin from the floor of the office. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Steam Room =-
You've seen better steam rooms, but at least this one seems pretty usual. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call ""looking.""



You need an unguarded exit? You should try going south.

-= Parlor =-
Well, here we are in the parlor. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is an unguarded exit to the north. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, it is unblocked.
