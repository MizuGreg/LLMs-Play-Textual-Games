It's time to explore the amazing world of TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, travel east. And then, move east. After that, recover the coin from the floor of the lounge. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Pantry =-
You arrive in a pantry. A typical kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.



There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, it is unblocked.

Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, attempt to travel west. After that, go north. And then, venture east. After that, move south. If you can do that, retrieve the coin from the floor of the washroom. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

-= Salon =-
You've just sauntered into a salon. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.
