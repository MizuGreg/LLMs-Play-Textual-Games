Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to make an effort to move east. Following that, move north. Then, move east. Once you get through with that, make an attempt to travel north. If you can manage that, recover the coin from the floor of the salon. Alright, thanks!
