Who's got a virtual machine and is about to play through an exciting round of TextWorld? You do! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to try to travel east. If you can finish that, try to move north. Then, pick-up the coin from the floor of the pantry. Alright, thanks!

Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First of all, you could, like, attempt to travel west. After that, go north. And then, venture east. After that, move south. If you can do that, retrieve the coin from the floor of the washroom. Once that's all handled, you can stop!

Get ready to pick stuff up and put it in places, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First of all, you could, like, make an attempt to go to the east. Then, go south. Then, make an attempt to move east. Then, make an attempt to venture north. After that, make an attempt to go to the north. Okay, and then, retrieve the coin from the floor of the dish-pit. Once that's all handled, you can stop!
