I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've just entered TextWorld! Here is your task for today. First off, if it's not too much trouble, I need you to try to move north. Following that, recover the loaf of bread from the floor of the playroom. And once you've done that, you win!

-= Bedchamber =-
You arrive in a bedchamber. A standard kind of place.



You need an unblocked exit? You should try going east. There is an unblocked exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is unblocked.
