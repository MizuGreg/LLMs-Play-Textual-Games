-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. You start to take note of what's in the room.

You can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a yellow onion, a raw yellow potato and a white onion. You wonder idly who left that here. What's that over there? It looks like it's an oven. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. But the thing is empty. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

Well, here we are in a kitchen.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a green apple and a red bell pepper. You can see an oven. You make out a table. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You see a counter. But the thing is empty. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. But the thing is empty. You swear loudly.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a carrot, a green bell pepper, a green apple, an orange bell pepper and a raw red tuna. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. On the counter you can see a green hot pepper, a banana, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it.

You're now in the kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a red onion, a red bell pepper, a yellow onion, a carrot and a lettuce. You can make out a closed oven in the room. You can see a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper, a raw red potato and a yellow bell pepper. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just shown up in a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a fridge. The fridge contains a white onion, a raw white tuna, a raw pork chop, a red onion, a raw red tuna, a lettuce and a carrot. You can make out a closed oven in the corner. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Huh, weird. You make out a counter. On the counter you make out a red hot pepper, a yellow apple, a red apple, a green hot pepper, a green apple and a knife. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well

You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a lettuce, a yellow apple, a green hot pepper, a raw white tuna and a yellow onion. You can see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a red apple and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. You swear loudly.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
Fancy seeing you here. Here, by the way, being the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's here.

Look over there! a fridge. The fridge contains a lettuce, a carrot, a raw red tuna and a white onion. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an oven. Huh, weird. You can make out a table. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato and a red hot pepper. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Livingroom =-
You are in a livingroom. A standard one.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a sofa. The sofa is comfy. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a sofa in a room. Were you looking for an end table? Because look over there, it's an end table. You see a cushion on the end table. You can see a TV stand. You see a magazine on the TV stand. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things.
