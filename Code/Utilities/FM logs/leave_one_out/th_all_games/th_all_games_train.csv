You arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

Oh, great. Here's a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a red onion and a block of cheese. What's that over there? It looks like it's an oven. Classic TextWorld. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Classic TextWorld. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

Look at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.

You can see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You make out an oven. You see a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a knife. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove appears to be empty.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. The fridge is empty, what a horrible day! You can make out a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. The table is massive. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You can see a counter. You see a tomato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. The stove appears to be empty.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

You can see an opened fridge nearby. The fridge is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. Look over there! a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple, a red onion, a yellow apple and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You've entered a kitchen.

An open fridge is right there by you. The fridge contains a raw pork chop and a yellow onion, so there's that. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see an oven. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You make out a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. The table is massive. However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst.

You've entered a kitchen.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. The fridge contains a raw red tuna, a raw red potato, a lettuce, a raw white tuna, an orange bell pepper, a yellow onion, a raw pork chop and a carrot. You can make out an oven. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You see a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a red apple, a green hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. You can see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But there isn't a thing on it.

You are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. The room is well lit.

You can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a block of cheese, a red bell pepper, a white onion, a carrot, a lettuce and a yellow bell pepper. You see an oven. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You can see a table. On the table you can see a knife. You make out a counter. You see a red hot pepper, a tomato and a cookbook on the counter. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You are in a kitchen. An usual one.

You make out a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a red bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a red apple, a green hot pepper and a block of cheese. You can see a closed oven in the room. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. But the thing is empty. Look over there! a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one. The room is well lit.

An open conventional looking fridge is right there by you. The fridge contains a carrot, an orange bell pepper, a red bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an oven. You make out a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you can make out a raw yellow potato, a yellow apple, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. This always happens!

Well, here we are in a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

Were you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. The fridge contains a raw white tuna, a yellow onion, a white onion, a raw red tuna, a yellow apple, a red onion and a carrot! Oh, great. Here's an oven. You see a table. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

You arrive in a kitchen. A standard one.

You can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a raw white tuna, a red onion, a yellow apple and an orange bell pepper. You see a closed oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A standard one. The room is well lit.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The fridge contains a raw pork chop and a white onion. A closed conventional looking oven is here. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. On the table you can make out a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You've entered a kitchen.

You see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese and a raw pork chop. You smell a lovely smell, and follow it to an oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out a counter. You see a tomato on the counter. Huh, weird. You see a stove. But the thing is empty.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You arrive in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call ""looking.""

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a white onion, a red bell pepper, a red onion, a raw white tuna and a raw yellow potato. You see an oven. Wow, check out the price tag on the oven! A hundred bucks! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You make out a counter. You see a knife on the counter. You can see a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a white onion, an orange bell pepper, a raw red tuna, a raw white tuna, a red onion, a lettuce and a yellow onion. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a closed oven here. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. On the table you see a cookbook. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a yellow apple, a raw purple potato, a banana, a raw yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a red apple and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

An open fridge is in the room. The fridge contains a lettuce, a yellow bell pepper, a block of cheese, a yellow onion, an orange bell pepper, a carrot, a raw red tuna, a raw pork chop and a green bell pepper. You can make out a closed oven close by. You make out a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red apple and a knife. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. The stove appears to be empty.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains a yellow onion, a raw red tuna and a red bell pepper! You can make out a closed oven here. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. Huh, weird. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a tomato, a banana and a green apple. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['chop', 'close', 'cook', 'dice', 'drink', 'drop', 'eat', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'prepare', 'put', 'slice', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Pantry =-
You've seen better pantrys, but at least this one seems pretty usual.

Look over there! a shelf. The shelf is wooden. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south.

-= Livingroom =-
You find yourself in a livingroom. An ordinary one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You see a sofa. However, the sofa, like an empty sofa, has nothing on it.

There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

Well I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen.

You can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a carrot. You can make out an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. You see a knife on the table. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

There is an open plain door leading east. There is an exit to the south.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Pantry =-
You arrive in a pantry. An usual one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a shelf. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well

There is an open plain door leading north.

-= Kitchen =-
Ah, the kitchen. This is some kind of kitchen, really great usual vibes in this place, a wonderful usual atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You make out a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. The fridge contains a yellow onion, a yellow apple and a red onion. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You see a closed oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook on the table. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a green hot pepper and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You make out a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

There is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the west.

-= Kitchen =-
I am sorry to announce that you are now in the kitchen.

You can see a fridge. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a closed oven right there by you. You can make out a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You see a green apple, a green bell pepper, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You've just walked into a kitchen. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call ""looking.""

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a raw red tuna, a green bell pepper and an orange bell pepper. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You see an oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. You see a knife on the table. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You see a counter. You see a red hot pepper, a green hot pepper, a red onion, a red bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a tomato, a yellow apple and a cookbook on the counter. You make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a stove in a room.

There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the west.

You find yourself in a livingroom. A standard kind of place. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can make out a sofa. The sofa is comfy. However, the sofa, like an empty sofa, has nothing on it.

You arrive in a kitchen. A normal one.

You see a fridge. Hmmm... what else, what else? The fridge contains a red onion, a raw red potato and a white onion. You can see a closed oven right there by you. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a table. You see a cookbook on the table, so there's that. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a tomato, a raw purple potato and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just walked into a kitchen.

You can make out a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. The fridge contains a block of cheese and a red bell pepper. You see an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a counter. You see a raw yellow potato, a yellow onion, a raw red potato, a raw purple potato and a knife on the counter. You see a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open plain door leading west. There is an exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You see a yellow apple, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty.

There is an open plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

You've entered a pantry. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a shelf. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hm. Oh well

There is an open frosted-glass door leading west.

Well I'll be, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a yellow apple, a raw red potato and a cookbook. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You can see a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The stove is conventional. The stove appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well

There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.

You see an opened fridge in the corner. The fridge contains a carrot, a red bell pepper, a raw red tuna and a raw pork chop, so there's that. You make out a closed oven right there by you. You see a table! The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the table! oh well. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red apple, a red onion, a yellow apple, a tomato, a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a stove. The stove appears to be empty.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Livingroom =-
You are in a livingroom. A typical one.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a wastepaper basket. The wastepaper basket is empty, what a horrible day! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a sofa. The sofa is comfy. The sofa appears to be empty. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an end table. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? The end table is wooden. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.



There is a magazine and an used tissue on the floor.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Backyard =-
You arrive in a backyard. An ordinary kind of place.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a clothesline. But there isn't a thing on it. You scan the room for a patio table, and you find a patio table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a patio table, go to TextWorld. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.



There is a wet white skirt and a wet teal skirt on the floor.

-= Laundry Room =-
You are in a laundry room. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a washing machine. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The washing machine is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out an opened laundry basket. The laundry basket is empty, what a horrible day!



There is a dirty tank top and a dirty brown skirt on the floor.

-= Corridor =-
You have fallen into a corridor. Not the corridor you'd expect. No, this is a corridor. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

Oh, great. Here's an umbrella stand. The umbrella stand appears to be empty. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a coat hanger. But the thing is empty.



There is an umbrella, a scarf and a gray coat on the floor.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Pantry =-
You find yourself in a standard kind of place. That is to say, you're in a pantry. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You make out a shelf. The shelf is wooden. However, the shelf, like an empty shelf, has nothing on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a folding chair. The folding chair is wooden. On the folding chair you see a yellow onion and a red onion.

You can make out an opened standard looking washing machine close by. The washing machine is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out an opened laundry basket nearby. The laundry basket is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever!

You make out a shelf. Now why would someone leave that there? However, the shelf, like an empty shelf, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the shelf! oh well. You can make out a folding chair. The folding chair is wooden. On the folding chair you can see a white onion.

You arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a fridge, so there's that. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! Were you looking for a kitchen cupboard? Because look over there, it's a kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard is empty, what a horrible day! You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a trash can, so there's that. The trash can is empty, what a horrible day! You can make out a dining table. You see a clean colander on the dining table.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You can make out an opened kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard is empty, what a horrible day! An open oven is close by. What a letdown! The oven is empty! You scan the room for a dining table, and you find a dining table. The dining table is massive.

-= Bedroom =-
You've entered a bedroom. Let's see what's in here.

You make out a wardrobe. The wardrobe is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a bed. The bed is large. The bed appears to be empty. Hey, want to see a desk? Look over there, a desk. The desk appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?



There is a clean black skirt on the floor.

-= Backyard =-
You're now in the backyard.

You can make out a BBQ. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a clothesline. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a clothesline? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a workbench. On the workbench you see a pair of wet black socks.

You arrive in a livingroom. A standard one.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a wastepaper basket. The wastepaper basket is empty, what a horrible day! You can make out a sofa. You see a magazine on the sofa. You see an end table. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the end table.

You can make out a sofa. The sofa is comfy. However, the sofa, like an empty sofa, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the sofa. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an end table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You make out a coffee table. The coffee table is small. On the coffee table you see a cushion.
