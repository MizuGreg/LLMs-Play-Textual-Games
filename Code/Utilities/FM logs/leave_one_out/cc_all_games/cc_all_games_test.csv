Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. On the table you can see a cookbook. You make out a counter. You see a knife on the counter, so there's that. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one.

You make out a fridge. Now why would someone leave that there? The fridge contains a block of cheese. Is this it? Is this what you came to TextWorld to see? a fridge? You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an oven! You make out a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Wow! Just like in the movies! You can make out a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You move on, clearly infuriated by your TextWorld experience. Oh, great. Here's a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

Look at you, bigshot, walking into a kitchen like it isn't some huge deal.

Look over there! a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a red onion and a white onion. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can make out a closed oven nearby. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you make out a cookbook. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. An ordinary kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out a BBQ. On the BBQ you can see a wet jacket. You scan the room for a clothesline, and you find a clothesline. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio chair. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens!



There is a wet black T-shirt on the floor.

-= Corridor =-
You make another one of your grand eccentric entrances into a corridor.

You can see a hat rack. The hat rack is ordinary. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the hat rack.



There is a straw hat on the floor.
