An open wastepaper basket is right there by you. The wastepaper basket is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out a sofa. The sofa is comfy. On the sofa you can make out some wastepaper. Now that's what I call TextWorld! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see an end table. The end table is wooden. The end table appears to be empty.

You make another one of your grand eccentric entrances into a corridor.

You're now in the backyard. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a clothesline. But the thing is empty. Hey, want to see a patio chair? Look over there, a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. On the patio chair you make out a wet jacket.

-= Backyard =-
You've moved into an ordinary room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be ordinary. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the backyard. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call ""looking.""

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. However, the BBQ, like an empty BBQ, has nothing on it. You can see a clothesline! The clothesline is usual. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out a patio chair. Now why would someone leave that there? On the patio chair you make out a wet gray polo shirt.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. An usual one. You can barely contain your excitement.

You see a BBQ. You see a wet hawaiian shirt on the BBQ. You make out a clothesline. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a workbench. The workbench is wooden. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

You find yourself in a bedroom. A normal kind of place.

You make out a wardrobe. Hmmm... what else, what else? Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can see a bed. But the thing is empty. You can see a dressing table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You find yourself in a backyard. An ordinary one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out a BBQ. The BBQ appears to be empty. You scan the room for a clothesline, and you find a clothesline. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio chair. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens!



There is a wet magenta dress and a pair of wet blue socks on the floor.

You can see an opened washing machine. The washing machine is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You scan the room, seeing a suspended shelf. The suspended shelf is normal. However, the suspended shelf, like an empty suspended shelf, has nothing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!



There is a washing powder and a dirty hoodie on the floor.

You find yourself in a backyard. A typical one. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a wet striped blazer and a pair of wet black underpants on the BBQ. You can make out a clothesline. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio chair. On the patio chair you can make out a wet orange dress.

-= Bathroom =-
You've just sauntered into a bathroom.

You see a shower. The shower contains a razor. You see a bathroom cabinet. What a letdown! The bathroom cabinet is empty! You can make out a toilet. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You see a mouthwash on the toilet. Were you looking for a sink? Because look over there, it's a sink. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.



There is a comb on the floor.
