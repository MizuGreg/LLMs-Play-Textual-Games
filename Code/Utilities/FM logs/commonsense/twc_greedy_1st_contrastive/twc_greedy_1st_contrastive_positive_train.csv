Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Backyard =-
You're now in the backyard. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a clothesline. But the thing is empty. Hey, want to see a patio chair? Look over there, a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. On the patio chair you make out a wet jacket.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A standard kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can see an opened fridge nearby. The fridge contains some sugar! You make out an opened kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard is empty, what a horrible day! You can make out a dining table! The dining table is massive. On the dining table you see a clean roasting tray. Oh, great. Here's a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. What's the point of an empty counter?

I just think it's great that you've just entered a kitchen.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? An open kitchen cupboard is here. The kitchen cupboard contains a white tuna. You make out a dining table. The dining table is massive. On the dining table you can see a potato peeler. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.

You find yourself in a pantry. An ordinary kind of place. Let's see what's in here.

You make out a shelf. But there isn't a thing on it. You scan the room for a folding chair, and you find a folding chair. You see a yellow onion, a red hot pepper and some black pepper on the folding chair. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Pantry =-
You arrive in a pantry. Let's see what's in here.

Were you looking for a shelf? Because look over there, it's a shelf. The shelf is wooden. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a folding chair. On the folding chair you make out a green hot pepper, a red hot pepper and some peanut oil. Wow! Just like in the movies!

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Bathroom =-
Of every bathroom you could have walked into, you had to saunter into a typical one.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a shower. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a toilet. The toilet is white. On the toilet you can make out some shampoo. You see a sink. The sink is ordinary. However, the sink, like an empty sink, has nothing on it. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a towel rail. However, the towel rail, like an empty towel rail, has nothing on it.

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

There is a towel on the floor.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Corridor =-
You arrive in a corridor. An usual kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.

You see an umbrella stand. The umbrella stand is normal. However, the umbrella stand, like an empty umbrella stand, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is an umbrella on the floor.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Backyard =-
You've just walked into a backyard.

You can see a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. On the BBQ you see a pair of wet black panties. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a clothesline. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Silly clothesline, silly, empty, good for nothing clothesline. You see a patio chair. On the patio chair you see a wet blue pullover.

There is an open patio door leading west.

There is a wet orange dress on the floor.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a key holder. The key holder is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open patio door leading east.

Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a patio table. The patio table is stylish. On the patio table you can see a wet plaid blazer.

There is an open patio door leading north.

-= Corridor =-
You find yourself in a corridor. An ordinary kind of place.

Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an umbrella stand. The umbrella stand is normal. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an exit to the south.

There is a dirty brown skirt on the floor.

-= Laundry Room =-
You are in a laundry room. An ordinary one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out a washing machine. What a letdown! The washing machine is empty! You see a laundry basket. Hmmm... what else, what else? The laundry basket contains a dirty checkered pullover.

You need an exit without a door? You should try going north.

There is an umbrella on the floor.
