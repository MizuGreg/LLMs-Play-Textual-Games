Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. An ordinary one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out a BBQ. The BBQ appears to be empty. You scan the room for a clothesline, and you find a clothesline. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio chair. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens!

-= Corridor =-
You arrive in a corridor. An usual kind of place. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call ""looking.""

You can see a shoe cabinet. The shoe cabinet is empty, what a horrible day! Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an umbrella stand. The umbrella stand is typical. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.



There is an umbrella, a pair of flip flops and a pair of blue moccasins on the floor.

Well, here we are in a bathroom.

You make out an opened shower. The shower is empty! What a waste of a day! You make out a toilet. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You can see a sink. The sink is standard. On the sink you can see a dirty gray shirt. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out a toilet roll holder. But the thing is empty.

There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

You are in a laundry room. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can see an opened washing machine right there by you. The washing machine is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out a bench. On the bench you can see a dirty checkered pullover. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this!

You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

There is a dirty white T-shirt on the floor.

-= Laundry Room =-
You are in a laundry room. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can see an opened washing machine right there by you. The washing machine is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out a bench. On the bench you can see a dirty checkered pullover. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this!

You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.
