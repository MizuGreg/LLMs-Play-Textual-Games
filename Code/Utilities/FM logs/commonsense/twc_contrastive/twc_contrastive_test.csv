Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. An ordinary kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You make out a BBQ. On the BBQ you can see a wet jacket. You scan the room for a clothesline, and you find a clothesline. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a patio chair. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens!



There is a wet black T-shirt on the floor.
