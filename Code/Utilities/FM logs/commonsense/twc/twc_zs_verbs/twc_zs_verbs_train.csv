Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Livingroom =-
You are in a livingroom. A typical one.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a wastepaper basket. The wastepaper basket is empty, what a horrible day! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a sofa. The sofa is comfy. The sofa appears to be empty. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice an end table. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? The end table is wooden. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.



There is a magazine and an used tissue on the floor.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Backyard =-
You arrive in a backyard. An ordinary kind of place.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a clothesline. But there isn't a thing on it. You scan the room for a patio table, and you find a patio table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a patio table, go to TextWorld. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a washing machine. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. The washing machine is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You make out an opened laundry basket. The laundry basket is empty, what a horrible day!



There is a dirty tank top and a dirty brown skirt on the floor.

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Corridor =-
You have fallen into a corridor. Not the corridor you'd expect. No, this is a corridor. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

Oh, great. Here's an umbrella stand. The umbrella stand appears to be empty. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a coat hanger. But the thing is empty.



There is an umbrella, a scarf and a gray coat on the floor.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Pantry =-
You find yourself in a standard kind of place. That is to say, you're in a pantry. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You make out a shelf. The shelf is wooden. However, the shelf, like an empty shelf, has nothing on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a folding chair. The folding chair is wooden. On the folding chair you see a yellow onion and a red onion.



these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Laundry Room =-
You've fallen into a typical room. Your mind races to think of what kind of room would be typical. And then it hits you. Of course. You're in the laundry room. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You can make out an opened standard looking washing machine close by. The washing machine is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out an opened laundry basket nearby. The laundry basket is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever!



There is a dirty azure skirt on the floor.

-= Pantry =-
This is going to sound unbelievable, but you've just entered a pantry. Let's see what's in here.

You make out a shelf. Now why would someone leave that there? However, the shelf, like an empty shelf, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the shelf! oh well. You can make out a folding chair. The folding chair is wooden. On the folding chair you can see a white onion.

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. An usual kind of place. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out a fridge, so there's that. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! Were you looking for a kitchen cupboard? Because look over there, it's a kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard is empty, what a horrible day! You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a trash can, so there's that. The trash can is empty, what a horrible day! You can make out a dining table. You see a clean colander on the dining table.

You've entered a bedroom. Let's see what's in here.

You make out a wardrobe. The wardrobe is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a bed. The bed is large. The bed appears to be empty. Hey, want to see a desk? Look over there, a desk. The desk appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

-= Backyard =-
You're now in the backyard.

You can make out a BBQ. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a clothesline. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a clothesline? Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a workbench. On the workbench you see a pair of wet black socks.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a wastepaper basket. The wastepaper basket is empty, what a horrible day! You can make out a sofa. You see a magazine on the sofa. You see an end table. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the end table.

You've entered a livingroom.

You can make out a sofa. The sofa is comfy. However, the sofa, like an empty sofa, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the sofa. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just an end table. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You make out a coffee table. The coffee table is small. On the coffee table you see a cushion.
