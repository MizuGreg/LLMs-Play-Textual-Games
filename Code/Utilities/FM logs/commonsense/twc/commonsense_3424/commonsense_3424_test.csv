Welcome to TextWorld! You find yourself in a messy house. Many things are not in their usual location. Let's clean up this place. Once you are done, this little house is going to be spick and span! Look for anything that is out of place and put it away in its proper location.

-= Backyard =-
You find yourself in a backyard. A normal one.

You make out a BBQ. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You make out a clothesline. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make out a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.



There is a wet plaid jumper on the floor.

-= Livingroom =-
You are in a livingroom. A normal one.

You can make out a bookcase. The bookcase is empty! What a waste of a day! Hey, want to see a sofa? Look over there, a sofa. The sofa is comfy. The sofa appears to be empty. You can see an end table. The end table is wooden. However, the end table, like an empty end table, has nothing on it. You think about smashing the end table to bits, throwing the bits in the dump, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on.
