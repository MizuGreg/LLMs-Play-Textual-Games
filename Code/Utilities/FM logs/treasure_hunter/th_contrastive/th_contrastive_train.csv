Hey, thanks for coming over to the TextWorld today, there is something I need you to do for me. First, it would be fantastic if you could move east. And then, recover the nest of shrimp from the floor of the bathroom. And once you've done that, you win!

There is an unblocked exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, it is unblocked. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is unguarded.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['close', 'drop', 'eat', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'put', 'take', 'unlock'].
