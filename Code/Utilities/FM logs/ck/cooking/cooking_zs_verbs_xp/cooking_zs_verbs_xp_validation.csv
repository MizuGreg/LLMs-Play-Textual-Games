You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You find yourself in a kitchen. A typical kind of place. You begin looking for stuff.

You see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. A closed conventional looking oven is here. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You move on, clearly depressed by your TextWorld experience. You see a counter. On the counter you make out a yellow apple, a green hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You've just walked into a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop and a cilantro. You can make out a closed oven here. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Hm. Oh well You see a counter. On the counter you can see a red hot pepper, a red apple, an orange bell pepper, a raw red potato, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a raw red potato and a white onion. What's that over there? It looks like it's an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well
