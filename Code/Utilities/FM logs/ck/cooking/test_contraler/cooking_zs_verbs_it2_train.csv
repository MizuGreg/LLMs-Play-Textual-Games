You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You're now in a kitchen.

You can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a chopped roasted white onion, a raw white tuna, a red onion and a raw chicken wing. You can make out an oven. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You make out a table. On the table you make out a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a cookbook. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

You are in a kitchen. A normal one. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a chopped roasted yellow apple, a yellow onion and a red apple. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You've just shown up in a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a closed oven in the corner. You can see a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. On the table you can see a knife. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a fried yellow potato, a yellow apple, a raw red potato and a cookbook. You make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm.

You are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

You see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a roasted chicken breast, a raw chicken wing and a yellow bell pepper! You can see an oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato. You can see a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

Okay, so you're in a kitchen, cool, but is it standard? You better believe it is.

You make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains a fried carrot. You can see an oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. The counter is vast. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You're now in the kitchen.

You make out a fridge, so there's that. The fridge contains a roasted white onion, a raw white tuna, a red onion, a raw chicken wing, a raw egg and a yellow bell pepper. You wonder idly who left that here. You make out an oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. The table is massive. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper, a red apple and a cookbook on the counter. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You see an opened fridge in the room. The fridge contains a red onion. You can make out a closed oven here. You can see a table. You see a cookbook on the table. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. On the counter you can see a fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a tomato. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

You find yourself in a kitchen. A standard one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can see an opened fridge in the room. The fridge contains a diced fried carrot and a raw chicken wing. You can make out a closed oven in the room. You see a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.

An open fridge, which looks conventional, is close by. The fridge is empty, what a horrible day! You can see an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter. On the counter you can see a diced roasted yellow apple, a yellow bell pepper, a red apple, a tomato, a raw red potato and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You can make out a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a closed oven. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. The table is massive. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You think about smashing the table to bits, throwing the bits into a pit, etc, until you get bored and decide to move on. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. You see a chopped roasted yellow potato, a yellow apple, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. You make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

You are in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.

You see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a roasted white tuna, a white onion, a raw red tuna and an orange bell pepper. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can make out an oven. You smell a fine smell, and follow it to a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You make out a fridge. The fridge contains a diced fried pork chop. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can make out an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You make out a counter. The counter is vast.
