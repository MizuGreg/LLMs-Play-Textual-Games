You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

You make out an opened fridge here. The fridge contains a raw chicken breast, a raw white tuna and some milk. You see an oven. You make out a table. You wonder idly who left that here. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife, so there's that. You see a counter. You see a sliced fried red apple, a red onion and a yellow apple on the counter. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A standard one.

You can see a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. The fridge contains a raw white tuna. You can make out a closed oven. You make out a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried yellow apple, a yellow bell pepper, a red apple, a green hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove! The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You have moved into the most usual of all possible kitchens. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried red tuna, a red bell pepper, a raw white tuna, a block of cheese and an orange bell pepper. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a raw red potato, a banana and a cookbook. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You find yourself in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.

You make out a fridge. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. The fridge contains a carrot. You can see an oven. You can see a table. You see a cookbook on the table. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a knife. You can make out a stove. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

Of every kitchen you could have sauntered into, you had to show up in a standard one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a roasted green bell pepper, a green hot pepper, a white onion and a cilantro. Look over there! an oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife. Huh, weird. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a red hot pepper and a cookbook on the counter. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

This might come as a shock to you, but you've just come into a kitchen.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a fried red bell pepper, a raw red potato and a green hot pepper. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see an oven. You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You make out a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook and a knife. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

You are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop and a carrot. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. You see a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?
