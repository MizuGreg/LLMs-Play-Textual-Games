I am required to announce that you are now in the kitchen.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a fried egg. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a closed oven. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a knife. You can make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You swear loudly.

Well, here we are in a kitchen.

You can see a fridge. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The fridge is empty, what a horrible day! You can make out a closed oven. You make out a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a cookbook on the table. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a roasted red potato, a raw red tuna, a raw purple potato and a knife. Oh, great. Here's a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a white onion, a raw white tuna and a red onion. Does this look like anything mentioned in the instructions? A closed oven is nearby. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You can make out a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw purple potato, a raw red potato and a knife. Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. You swear loudly.
