You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's here.

You see an opened fridge in the room. The fridge contains a red onion. You can make out a closed oven here. You can see a table. You see a cookbook on the table. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. On the counter you can see a fried purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a tomato. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

You've entered a kitchen.

You see an opened fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You make out an oven. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a fried red apple, a red onion, a yellow apple and a knife. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You swear loudly.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
Well, here we are in a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a fried red tuna, a red onion and a raw white tuna. A closed oven is nearby. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You scan the room, seeing a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.
