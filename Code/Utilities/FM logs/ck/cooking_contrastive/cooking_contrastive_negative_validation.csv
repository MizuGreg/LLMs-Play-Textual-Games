You find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a sliced roasted lettuce. You make out a closed oven in the corner. You can see a table. On the table you can see a cookbook. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can see a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove appears to be empty.

You've entered a kitchen.

Were you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. The fridge contains a lettuce, a yellow bell pepper, a yellow onion and an orange bell pepper. You can make out a closed oven nearby. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. This always happens! You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook and a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

You are in a kitchen. A standard one.

You can see a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. The fridge contains a cilantro. You can make out a closed oven. You make out a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a fried red hot pepper, a red apple, an orange bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You see a stove! The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

You are in a kitchen. A standard one.

You can see a fridge. The fridge contains a chopped fried pork chop and a yellow bell pepper. You check the price tag on the fridge. Two hundred big ones?! That's ridiculous! You know my friend, they work for the post office? I'm sure my friend could get you one of those for 20 bucks! You see an oven. You check the price tag glued to the oven. Ninety big ones?! That's ridiculous! I know a person, their aunt works for the prime minister, who could get you one of those for 30 bucks! You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw yellow potato. You see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

You've entered a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You can see a fridge. Hmm. You always thought you'd be more excited to see a fridge in a room. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. On the counter you can make out a roasted purple potato, a raw yellow potato and a banana. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've just shown up in a kitchen. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You see a closed oven. You see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a red onion, an orange bell pepper, a banana, a cookbook and a knife. Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.
