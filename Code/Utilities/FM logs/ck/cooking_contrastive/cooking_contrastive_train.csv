You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You are in a kitchen. A normal one. You can barely contain your excitement.

You can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a chopped roasted yellow apple, a yellow onion and a red apple. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

Well, here we are in the kitchen.

You make out an opened fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You can see a closed oven in the room. You make out a table. On the table you see a knife. You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a counter. On the counter you can make out a green hot pepper, a green apple, a red bell pepper, a red apple, a banana and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

You find yourself in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The fridge contains a white onion and a block of cheese. You make out a closed oven nearby. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. On the table you can see a cookbook. You smell a great smell, and follow it to a counter. You see a chopped fried banana and a knife on the counter. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You make out a stove. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen. You begin looking for stuff.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The fridge contains a cilantro. You make out an oven. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You can make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a sliced fried red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw yellow potato and a black pepper. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

Look at that placard! What does it say? It says Welcome to the kitchen? Well that's cool.

You can see an opened fridge right there by you. The fridge contains a diced cilantro, a raw pork chop, a white onion, a red onion, a block of cheese, a parsley and some water. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Oh, great. Here's an oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. You see a raw purple potato on the counter. You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You move on, clearly depressed by TextWorld.

You find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.

You smell an awful smell, and follow it to a fridge. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see an oven. You shudder, but continue examining the room. Oh, great. Here's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a sliced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato. Huh, weird. Look over there! a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash.

Okay, so you're in a kitchen, cool, but is it standard? You better believe it is.

You make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains a diced roasted pork chop. You can see an oven. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. The counter is vast. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the counter. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You've just sauntered into a kitchen. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You can make out an opened fridge close by. The fridge contains a white onion, a raw pork chop and a parsley. You can see a closed oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. You can see a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the counter you see a fried banana, a red apple, a cookbook and a knife, so there's that. You scan the room, seeing a stove. The stove appears to be empty.

You've just walked into a kitchen.

Were you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop and a white onion! You make out an oven. You make out a table. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a knife on the table. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

You see an opened fridge nearby. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You can make out a closed oven. You can see a table. On the table you can see a cookbook. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a diced fried purple potato and a raw red potato. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You've entered a kitchen.

You can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a diced cilantro. You make out an oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a cookbook. You make out a stove. But the thing is empty.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A typical one.

You can make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a roasted carrot and some water, so there's that. You smell a great smell, and follow it to an oven. You smell a terrible smell, and follow it to a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a diced roasted red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

You make out an opened fridge right there by you. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You can see a counter. You see a chopped fried red potato, a chopped fried yellow potato, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato on the counter. Oh, great. Here's a stove. But the thing is empty.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced roasted white onion, a raw pork chop and a block of cheese. You smell a pungent smell, and follow it to an oven. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You move on, clearly done caring about your TextWorld experience. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a sliced fried red hot pepper, a red onion, a raw red potato, a black pepper, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. But the thing is empty. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You are in a kitchen. A standard one.

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a diced fried block of cheese. You make out an oven. Classic TextWorld. Look over there! a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make out a counter. You see a sliced roasted banana and a cookbook on the counter. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. Hm. Oh well

Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen.

You can see a fridge. The fridge contains a sliced parsley, an orange bell pepper and a raw pork chop. You can see a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You can see a counter. You see a diced fried yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a cookbook on the counter. Classic TextWorld. You see a stove.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
Guess what, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen.

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a yellow bell pepper, a raw pork chop, a red onion, an orange bell pepper and a white onion. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see a closed oven right there by you. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw yellow potato and a cookbook. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You move on, clearly infuriated by TextWorld.

You're now in a kitchen.

You make out a fridge. Huh, weird. The fridge contains a parsley. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You scan the room, seeing an oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. On the counter you see a green apple and a cookbook. You can make out a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains some milk. You see an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. This always happens, here in TextWorld! You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a counter. On the counter you can see a green apple, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well

I am required to announce that you are now in the kitchen.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. The fridge contains a fried egg. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a closed oven. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a knife. You can make out a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You swear loudly.

You make out a fridge, so there's that. The fridge contains a roasted white onion, a raw white tuna, a red onion, a raw chicken wing, a raw egg and a yellow bell pepper. You wonder idly who left that here. You make out an oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. The table is massive. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You scan the room, seeing a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? You see a raw purple potato, a red hot pepper, a red apple and a cookbook on the counter. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

If you're wondering why everything seems so ordinary all of a sudden, it's because you've just sauntered into the kitchen.

You make out an opened fridge here. The fridge contains a block of cheese. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You can see an oven. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can make out a stove. The stove appears to be empty.

You are in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop and a carrot. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. You see a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can make out a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You've just shown up in a kitchen.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge, so there's that. The fridge contains a white onion, a raw white tuna, a yellow onion and a raw red tuna, so there's that. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You make out a table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly. You make out a counter. On the counter you make out a green hot pepper, a yellow apple, a cookbook and a knife. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. You see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual kind of place.

Hey, want to see a fridge? Look over there, a fridge. Huh, weird. The fridge contains a red onion, a block of cheese, a red apple and a yellow onion. Huh, weird. You make out a closed oven right there by you. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a tomato. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a red bell pepper, a white onion, a yellow onion, an orange bell pepper, a block of cheese, a raw red tuna and a green bell pepper. You make out an oven. You see a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a counter.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A normal one.

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a white onion, a red onion, a raw red potato, a yellow onion, a raw white tuna, a green bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can make out an oven. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can make out a counter. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You see a green apple on the counter. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

You've entered a kitchen.

You make out a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You make out a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. You make out a counter. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a counter in a room. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. An usual one. You try to gain information on your surroundings by using a technique you call ""looking.""

You make out a fridge. The fridge contains a roasted white onion and a red onion. Now why would someone leave that there? You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. You make out a table. On the table you can make out a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a cookbook. You see a stove. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But the thing is empty. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

You find yourself in a kitchen. A normal one. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not?

You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese. You can see an oven. You see a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You see a counter. You see a knife on the counter. Wow! Just like in the movies! You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A typical kind of place.

You see an opened fridge in the room. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper. You can make out a closed oven here. You can see a table. You see a cookbook on the table. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. On the counter you can see a fried red potato, a red onion, a raw purple potato and a red hot pepper. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well

You're now in the kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

You see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a chopped orange bell pepper and a red hot pepper. You can make out a closed oven. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. The table is massive. However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a sliced roasted red potato, a red apple, a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove appears to be empty.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You're now in a kitchen.

You can see a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a block of cheese, a raw pork chop and a white onion. You can make out an oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. The table appears to be empty. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red hot pepper, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a banana, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

Well, here we are in the kitchen. Let's see what's in here.

Look over there! a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a red hot pepper and a white onion. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can see an oven. You can make out a table. On the table you make out a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a raw purple potato and a cookbook. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You've just shown up in a kitchen. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot. You make out an oven. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

You make out a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop and a white onion. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You can see a closed oven. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. You see a cookbook and a knife on the table. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. Oh, great. Here's a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.
