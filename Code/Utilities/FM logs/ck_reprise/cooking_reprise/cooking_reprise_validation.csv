You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a carrot, a green bell pepper, a green apple, an orange bell pepper and a raw red tuna. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Hey, want to see a counter? Look over there, a counter. On the counter you can see a green hot pepper, a banana, a red apple and a cookbook. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You find yourself in a kitchen. A standard kind of place. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You can see an opened fridge in the corner. The fridge contains a lettuce, a raw red tuna, a raw red potato, a raw white tuna, an orange bell pepper and a red onion. You can see an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. You can make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.
