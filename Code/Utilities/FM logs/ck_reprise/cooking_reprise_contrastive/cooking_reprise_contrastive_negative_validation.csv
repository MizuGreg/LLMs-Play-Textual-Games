You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Pantry =-
You arrive in a pantry. An usual one. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a shelf. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well

There is an open plain door leading north.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['chop', 'close', 'cook', 'dice', 'drink', 'drop', 'eat', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'prepare', 'put', 'slice', 'take', 'unlock'].

-= Kitchen =-
Ah, the kitchen. This is some kind of kitchen, really great usual vibes in this place, a wonderful usual atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

You make out a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. The fridge contains a yellow onion, a yellow apple and a red onion. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You see a closed oven. You make out a table. You see a cookbook on the table. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a green hot pepper and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You make out a stove. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

There is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the west.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a raw red tuna, a green bell pepper, a green apple, a red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw white tuna and a raw pork chop. A closed conventional looking oven is right there by you. Hey, want to see a table? Look over there, a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. But the thing is empty. What's the point of an empty table? You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

There is an open plain door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

these are the possible verbs you can use: ['chop', 'close', 'cook', 'dice', 'drink', 'drop', 'eat', 'examine', 'go', 'insert', 'inventory', 'lock', 'look', 'open', 'prepare', 'put', 'slice', 'take', 'unlock'].
