You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You arrive in a kitchen. A typical one. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.

You can make out an opened fridge close by. The fridge contains a red onion and a yellow bell pepper. You make out a closed oven. You scan the room for a table, and you find a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a counter. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a yellow apple and a knife. You make out a stove. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a stove, go to TextWorld. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.

Well how about that, you are in a place we're calling a kitchen.

You can see an opened conventional looking fridge in the room. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper, a yellow apple, an orange bell pepper and a carrot. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see an oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a table, go to TextWorld. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can make out a counter. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a counter, go to TextWorld. The counter appears to be empty. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

You are in a kitchen. A typical one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You make out a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a red bell pepper and a white onion. Classic TextWorld. You scan the room, seeing an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can see a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook and a knife. Hey, want to see a stove?

You've just shown up in a kitchen.

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a carrot, a raw white tuna and a yellow bell pepper. Now why would someone leave that there? You can see an oven. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You see a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red hot pepper, a red apple, an orange bell pepper, a green hot pepper, a yellow apple, a banana and a knife. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You can make out a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You find yourself in a kitchen. An usual one.

You make out a fridge. You shudder, but continue examining the room. The fridge contains a raw white tuna, a white onion and a raw red tuna. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out an oven. You look around you, at all the containers and supporters, doors and objects, and you think to yourself. Why? Why Textworld? You can make out a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. You see a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. Now that's what I call TextWorld! Hey, want to see a stove? Look over there, a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. This always happens!

You're now in a kitchen. I guess you better just go and list everything you see here.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a red bell pepper and a white onion, so there's that. You see an oven. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. The table is massive. On the table you can make out a knife. Hmmm... what else, what else? You see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a banana, a green apple and a cookbook. Classic TextWorld. You smell a fine smell, and follow it to a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage.

You arrive in a kitchen. A typical one.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a red bell pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper, a white onion and a block of cheese. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can make out an oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You can see a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a red apple, a yellow apple and a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a block of cheese, a yellow onion and a green bell pepper. You can see an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You make out a table. You shudder, but continue examining the table. On the table you can make out a knife. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. On the counter you make out a cookbook. You see a stove.

You find yourself in a kitchen.

You can see an opened fridge. The fridge contains a raw white tuna, an orange bell pepper, a green bell pepper, a white onion, a raw red tuna, a lettuce and a red onion. You see a closed oven. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You smell a sickening smell, and follow it to a counter. On the counter you can see a cookbook. It doesn't get more TextWorld than this! You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Hm. Oh well

Classic TextWorld. You see a table. The table is massive. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw yellow potato, a yellow onion, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

You've entered a kitchen.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese. You see a closed oven. You see a table. Now why would someone leave that there? The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You make out a counter. You see a green apple, a green bell pepper, a yellow apple, a raw purple potato, a green hot pepper, a red apple and a knife on the counter. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You smell a lovely smell, and follow it to a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

You are in an ordinary kind of place. That is to say, you're in a kitchen.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a yellow onion, a red bell pepper, a raw red tuna, a red hot pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a red onion and a raw white tuna. You see a closed oven in the corner. You can see a table. You wonder idly who left that here. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? Oh, great. Here's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a green apple, a green hot pepper, a banana, a cookbook and a knife, so there's that. You can see a stove! The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a green hot pepper, a tomato and a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You've entered a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You make out an opened fridge. The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a raw red tuna, a green apple, an orange bell pepper, a red apple, a raw white tuna and a red bell pepper. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing. A closed oven is in the corner. You see a table. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! On the table you see a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you can make out a red hot pepper, a tomato, a raw yellow potato, a red onion, a green hot pepper and a knife. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

Well, here we are in a kitchen.

You can make out a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a white onion, a raw white tuna, a yellow onion and a red onion. A closed oven is here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. On the table you make out a knife. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a green hot pepper, a green bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a tomato and a cookbook. You can see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a green bell pepper, a raw yellow potato and a raw pork chop. You can see a closed oven in the corner. You see a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You make out a counter. On the counter you make out a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a green hot pepper and a knife. Look over there! a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove appears to be empty. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

You see a yellow apple, a green hot pepper, a green apple, a red hot pepper, a yellow onion and a red apple on the counter, so there's that. You see a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best?

This might come as a shock to you, but you've just come into a kitchen.

If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The fridge contains a red bell pepper, an orange bell pepper, a yellow bell pepper, a red hot pepper and a green bell pepper. You make out a closed oven close by. You can make out a table. You see a knife on the table. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a counter. You see a raw yellow potato, a banana, a yellow onion, a raw red potato, a green apple, a yellow apple and a cookbook on the counter. You see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

You are in a kitchen. An ordinary kind of place. Let's see what's in here.

You make out an opened fridge in the corner. The fridge contains a green bell pepper, a raw white tuna, a white onion, a yellow onion, a raw red tuna, a lettuce, a red onion, a green apple, a red hot pepper and a block of cheese. Now why would someone leave that there? You see an oven. You can see a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. On the counter you can make out a green hot pepper, a red apple, a tomato, a raw yellow potato, a yellow bell pepper, a raw red potato, a yellow apple, a banana and a knife. Were you looking for a stove? Because look over there, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk.

You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A typical one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

Were you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. What a great pairing of adjectives and nouns! The fridge contains a red bell pepper, a red onion and a raw pork chop. You see a closed oven here. You make out a table. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter! You see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. You can see a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty.

There is an open plain door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Kitchen =-
You've just walked into a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a fridge. The fridge contains a white onion, a raw white tuna, a yellow onion, a lettuce, an orange bell pepper and a red onion. Oh, great. Here's an oven. What's that over there? It looks like it's a table. You see a cookbook on the table. You can see a counter. You see a red apple, a raw red potato and a knife on the counter. You make out a stove. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a stove? But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

If you're wondering why everything seems so typical all of a sudden, it's because you've just walked into the pantry.

You scan the room for a shelf, and you find a shelf. However, the shelf, like an empty shelf, has nothing on it. You move on, clearly infuriated by TextWorld.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading north.

I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a kitchen, but I guess I was wrong.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. The fridge contains a carrot. You see an oven. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You see a counter. On the counter you can see a cookbook. You can see a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

Ah, the kitchen. This is some kind of kitchen, really great ordinary vibes in this place, a wonderful ordinary atmosphere. And now, well, you're in it.

Were you looking for a fridge? Because look over there, it's a fridge. The fridge contains a raw white tuna, a white onion, a raw red tuna, an orange bell pepper and a red onion. You can make out a closed oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. But there isn't a thing on it. You see a counter. You see a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. Now why would someone leave that there? The stove appears to be empty.

You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You can see an opened fridge in the room. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You make out a closed oven. You can see a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh, great. Here's a counter. On the counter you can make out a green apple, a raw yellow potato, a green bell pepper, a red apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west.

You've just shown up in a kitchen.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. The fridge contains a raw pork chop, a red onion, a raw white tuna and a carrot. Look over there! an oven. Look over there! a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a raw purple potato, a raw red potato, a green apple and a cookbook. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a stove. The stove is conventional.

Fancy seeing you here. Here, by the way, being the kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You make out a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Silly table, silly, empty, good for nothing table. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. On the counter you can see a red apple, a raw red tuna, a green apple and a cookbook. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open plain door leading north. There is an exit to the east. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You've entered a kitchen.

You can make out a fridge. Now that's what I call TextWorld! The fridge contains a red onion, a red apple, a white onion, a raw white tuna and an orange bell pepper. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than an oven. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You scan the room, seeing a table. The table is massive. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Oh, great. Here's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a raw red potato, a red hot pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going east, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You've just walked into a kitchen. You begin to take stock of what's in the room.

What's that over there? It looks like it's a fridge. The fridge contains an orange bell pepper and a raw pork chop. You make out a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You see a counter. What a coincidence, weren't you just thinking about a counter? On the counter you make out a red hot pepper, a red apple, a raw red tuna, a yellow apple, a red onion, a yellow bell pepper, a banana and a knife. You make out a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst.

There is an open plain door leading south. There is an exit to the west.

It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a raw red potato, a red bell pepper, a raw yellow potato, a tomato and a cookbook. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You smell a fine smell, and follow it to a stove. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.
